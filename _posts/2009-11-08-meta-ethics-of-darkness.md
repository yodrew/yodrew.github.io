On the metaphysics of self-preservation: "Consciousness, for those organisms which possess it, is the basic means of survival." –Ayn Rand

This idea is one of the roots of _the darkness conjecture_. Our lives are so thoroughly screwed up because our consciousnesses is comprehensively impaired.

Generally, we try to use will---the most delicate part of the very faculty that is so damaged---to fix our problems. How is it working out for us? As a designer of the Los Angeles freeway system would later put it, "Each and every problem we face today is the direct and inevitable result of yesterday's brilliant solutions." If I were the left hand, I'd say the right hand's bluffing.

Which is why I think it would be better to use will to provide the organism, including consciousness, the conditions it needs to heal _itself_ autonomically, to do with ourselves as Rockefeller did with his company: "All I did was hire people who were smarter than me."
