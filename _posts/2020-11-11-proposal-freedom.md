Let's enact [scene: freedom](/blog/2020/11/scene-freedom/), end the crisis, and restore mankind to sanity. 

Other plans are possible. This is one example. It will take a team of 12 and $30k (4 people and $6k to start). It will becomes self-supporting within a year.

##### plan

- organization
    - you arrange funding, locations, suppliers, security, logistics, legal
    - I handle instruction, design, construction, and operation
    - we:
        - plan the work
        - begin documenting and developing the process with Lean and online open source tools
        - assemble a team: building, web/creative, legal (youarelaw.org), secretary (writing of manual), treasury, ?
- retreat
    - I begin conferring with team remotely 
        - about project
        - darkness: theory, protocol, design
    - team reads my book
    - you:
        - scout three locations for darkroom #1 
        - research where to scout for darkroom #2
        - arrange a month's shelter and transport for me
    - I: 
        - rendevous with team within six weeks
        - darkroom #1
            - select house from scouted locations 
            - darken it with team
            - support team's first retreats
            - train team as supporter
        - continue instruction and training in hygiene, Lean, open source documenters.
        - darkroom #2
            - scout locations
                - for medium retreats (3-8 weeks)
                - in new buildings
                - round, 3-6m diameter/7-30m2
                - space for 16 of them in two clusters: staff and guests
            - build
                - darkroom and 3 huts with team
                - support medium retreats
                - train further
- influence
    - organic
        - do what you've seen in darkness to do 
        - weekly group reports
        - be an ambassador: meet influencers of all classes worldwide
        - avoid becoming tools of reinvented elites
        - help others to the darkroom; find the ten who will turn the tide
    - politics
        - Individualist Party: for a distributed state
            - defines non-binding legal precepts based on natural law 
            - precepts provide basis of contracts (custom laws), and private defense and adjudication services
            - primarily focuses on private actors, not centralized politics: a distributed state will obsolete the centralized one
            - members who focus on centralized state will have an inverted strategy: not to win but to expose what is happening through satire (like Yes Men) and show the alternative
            - runs volunteer embassy to support missions to meet influential outsiders
        - distributed state
            - individuals legislate for themselves by applying precepts in private contracts
            - a contract specifies which defenders and judges will enforce it
            - legislature, executive, and judiciary are thus distributed throughout society at the individual level
        - openly conspiracist*
        - legal aid**
        - references
            - _Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal_, Ayn Rand
            - _Market for Liberty_, Morris and Linda Tannehill
            - _Moon is a Harsh Mistress_, Robert Heinlein

            - **YouAreLaw.org, TJ Marrs
    - Human Conditions Co
        - raises money through presale/crowdfund
        - rents/buys and takes over darkroom operation
        - expands prototype facility to 6 darkrooms, 16 buildings total, then multiplies
        - performs all functions: R&D, instruction, services, manufacturing

##### budget

The following is an example budget purely in terms of money. Comparable offers of other values considered. At minimum, I'd like to decently survive the crisis while being useful in reversing it.

|     $a |    $b | item |
| ------:| -----:| ---- |
|   6000 |       | fee to begin |
| ~24000 |       | project |
|        |  ~300 | my lodging and transport, first month there |
|        |  ~700 | darkroom #1 (rent + <400 for modifications) |
|        | 11000 | salary (11 months@1000) |
|        | ~9000 | darkroom #2 ($6k) and huts (3@$1k) |
|        | ~3000 | influence mission seed fund |
| ~30000 |       | total |

##### future

- mission becomes self-supporting from:
    - donations
        - political
        - productivity of participants increases
    - royalties from spin-offs like Human Conditions
- ending crisis is phase one
- phase 2
    - supports Individualist Party to deepen social sanity worldwide
    - forms Freedom Skunk Works to stay at the bleeding edge of social renewal 
    - extends diplomacy to space and other species and dimensions
    - ?
