Realizing a big idea requires three levels of work. First, one has to find the idea. Then one develops it into a practical solution. Then one applies it. 

I didn't know this 36 years ago. I thought it would be over in a couple years. The first phase took 21. I thought I could make it happen in weeks. But development had just begun. It lasted 11 years.

By then I knew where I was in the process. Application had begun, and it might take another 5 or 10 years to start succeeding. We are four years in. After countless failures for decades, I am just starting to get an idea of how to deliver my discovery to you.

I have good news.

### book

Three months ago, I starting offering [retreats](/store/enroll) again. Since then, I have worked non-stop on my book. I had somewhat neglected it for years. 

I fixed dozens of broken links and hundreds of typos and grammatical errors. I rewrote sentences, paragraphs, even whole sections for clarity. I moved some around for better organization.

I made thousands of improvements. More will come. But the book is better than it has ever been.

It is also back in print now. See [write](/store#write) (in my simple new store) for details.

[Andrew Tate](https://cobratate.com) inspired me to get going again. Hats off to him and his brother, Tristan. These super-heroic men are helping revive the souls of millions worldwide, and I am one of them.

### designs

Improving the book affected the designs. One by one, I reworked the darkroom components. Now all of them are as simple for what they do as the [door seal](/darkness#door-seal). It was my first truly elegant design, from about 10 years ago.

Now, each component is inherently adaptable. Little or no customization is involved. There are no more complicated formulas, no more intricate cuts or folds. Anyone a little crafty can make a darkroom in hours or days, not weeks. Everything is more durable and easier to use.

The absurdly fast and effective [double-blind](/darkness#double-blind) is the new standard for darkening windows. Along with the [panel](/darkness#panel), it obsoletes three of my other methods (now in the "old" folder in the [zip file](/darkroom-retreat.zip) of all designs).

The helix vent is renamed the [universal vent](/air#universal). Instead of origami, it is just rectangles of cardboard or wood, glued together. 

The [threshold vent](/air#threshold) used to be the most complicated design requiring tons of customization. Now one size fits virtually any door. 

Both vents are more durable.

The [fan mount](/air#fan-mount) now uses a 200mm fan. It is so much quieter than a 120mm fan, a silencer is often needless. I could remove half the webbing as well as the tricky suspended sticks. The webbing joins with an adjustable buckle made of wire, not staples or thread that damage it. 

The [silencer](/air#silencer), is skinnier, lighter and easier to handle. Later, it will work in pairs with a twin-fan heat recovery ventilator (still in the works).

The [toilet upgrade](/water#toilet) has a smaller, simpler lining. And there is a new optional separating, squatting version.

### Czech format

The new 9-day [Czech](/format#czech) retreat format provides the critical benefits of the standard 9-day retreat, but without a separate building and with only one supporter. So it is much easier to arrange. It gives the organism enough time to:

- heal noticeably and permanently from the most pressing issues in the being
- replace [false capacity](/hygiene#false-capacity) with normal [capacity](/hygiene#capacity) (and, as in my case, recover from the dreaded _over-loss_).

Being easier to arrange, more people can start with a 9-day retreat, which is far superior to a 5-day retreat.

A 5-day retreat still enables one to start retreating alone at home when there is no other option. But an easier way was needed to get from 5- to 9-day retreats. The Czech approach provides the missing rung in the [ladder](/format#ladder).

Figuring out this format is another benefit I recently gained from my 2-year stay in Czech Republic.

### implication

The 9-day Czech retreat and simplified designs change everything. Now I can travel to a place you provide, darken it quickly (2-3 days), and support as little as one retreat. See [enroll](/store/enroll) for details.

That's my news. I hope it inspires you to:

- read or re-read my book 
- build a darkroom at home 
- or bring me to your place to build one and support your retreat

Cheers,
--A
