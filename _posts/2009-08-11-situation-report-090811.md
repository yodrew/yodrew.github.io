If you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this culture remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow this post to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I invite you to avail yourself of the vivifying veracity of these volumes:

[Confessions of an Economic Hit Man](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081?ie=UTF8&tag=thedarknessco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0452287081)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0452287081) by John Perkins
A former perpetrator explains the precise mechanism of American imperial activity abroad. Not the [greatest](/other-writings/bibliography), but the most important book I have read in years.

[The New Pearl Harbor Revisited](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1566567297?ie=UTF8&tag=thedarknessco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1566567297)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thedarknessco-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1566567297) by David Ray Griffin, PhD
A relentless, unanswerable, comprehensive expos√© of Cheney's bombing of the World Trade Center, September 11, 2001, and the ensuing cover-up.
