If you've seen nothing, if the crimes of this culture remain unknown to you, then I would suggest you allow this post to pass unmarked. But if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I invite you to avail yourself of the vivifying veracity of these volumes:

_Confessions of an Economic Hit Man_ by John Perkins
A former perpetrator explains the precise mechanism of American imperial activity abroad. Not the [greatest](/other/bibliography), but the most important book I have read in years.

_The New Pearl Harbor Revisited_ by David Ray Griffin, PhD
A relentless, unanswerable, comprehensive exposé of Cheney's bombing of the World Trade Center, September 11, 2001, and the ensuing cover-up.
