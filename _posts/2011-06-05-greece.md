I moved to Greece, partly as a result of my darkness retreat in March (more on that soon). My new friend and final client in Guatemala, Ajna of [Yoga of Beauty](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317190059/http://www.yogaofbeauty.net/) in San Marcos La Laguna, Solola, Guatemala, is taking over the darkroom. Contact her through her website. I will be building a business here in Greece to open more darkrooms around the world.

Note: Ajna sold the darkroom to Arjuna. See his website, [dark-retreats.com](http://dark-retreats.com).
