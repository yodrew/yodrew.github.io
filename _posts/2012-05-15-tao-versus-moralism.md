#### tao te ching, chapter 38

The Master doesn't try to be powerful;  
thus he is truly powerful.  
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power;  
thus he never has enough.

The Master does nothing,  
yet he leaves nothing undone.  
The ordinary man is always doing things,  
yet many more are left to be done.

The kind man does something,  
yet something remains undone.  
The just man does something,  
and leaves many things to be done.  
The moral man does something,  
and when no one responds  
he rolls up his sleeves and uses force.

_When the Tao is lost, there is goodness._  
_When goodness is lost, there is morality._  
When morality is lost, there is ritual.  
Ritual is the husk of true faith,  
the beginning of chaos.

Therefore the Master concerns himself  
with the depths and not the surface,  
with the fruit and not the flower.  
He has no will of his own.  
He dwells in reality,  
and lets all illusions go.
