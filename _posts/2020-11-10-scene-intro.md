[Scene:  
Booth with sign:  
"Volunteers wanted. Must be clever, practical, and hopeful. Major personal benefits."]

D - What is your project?

A - We will apply nature's solution to major trauma.

D - That's a big deal. Few escape it.

A - I agree, it is tough and it is epidemic. I suffer from it myself. Fortunately, nature gives us a specific condition to heal from major trauma. I discovered and developed it as a practical solution. Everyone can do it.

D - What it is?

A - Darkness. In perfect darkness, the organism rests deeply. With enough time, it heals itself of everything. So one makes extended stays in darkness. It is called hygienic darkroom retreating.

D - I never heard of it. But it makes sense. How long do you retreat?

A - Eight days is best to start with, four at a minimum.

D - Ok. Why is it hygienic? Is it a cleaning process?

A - Hygiene is actually the science of health. It is a branch of biology. It consists of _all_ conditions and practices conducive to the preservation of health. These include knowledge, darkness, and rest, as well as cleanliness. Hygiene is a complete approach.

D - Hygiene is the science of health. I didn't know that. So it isn't a cult!

A - Haha, no. But you aren't entirely mistaken. Most spiritual traditions use darkness. I extracted it from that context. I made it strictly for health, reintegrating it within hygiene. Hygiene requires rationality, not strange beliefs or practices.

D - That's a relief.

A - Yes, we've all had enough superstition, both secular and religious.

D - Hear, hear. My name is David, by the way.

A - Glad to meet you, David. I'm Andrew.

D - Now, if you don't mind my asking: if this works, why do you still suffer?

A - I don't mind. Healing requires a team to fully apply the solution. I just finished developing it on my own.

D - I see. What does it take?

A - It takes three things: an informed retreater, sympathetic supporters, and an excellent darkroom.

D - Would you explain them a little?

A - Sure. Reading my book or even an hour's conversation imparts enough information to start with.

D - You wrote a book about this?

A - Yes. It's a complete manual, with theory, protocol, and construction plans. You can read it for free or download a cheap e-book at darkroomretreat.com. Or I sell paper copies.

D - I'll take one. [Makes exchange.] Please continue explaining.

A - A supporter is reliable and has common sense. He has retreated and found value in it. He has read my book and helped support a retreat.

D - Ok. And the darkroom?

A - It needs a small fully functional house in a quiet location. We darken it with simple removable components. It has a separate building a supporter can sleep and prepare food in.

D - It is all so reasonable. Iâ€¦

A - What is it?

D - It's funny. I was just talking with friends about childhood. None of us had it easy. It has seemed impossible to understand. This makes it so simple. Could you come tell us more about this?

A - Yes.

D - How about tonight at my place? Everyone is coming for dinner. They would love to hear about this. Maybe we'll all volunteer.

A - Great!

D - Here is my address and phone number. I'm glad to meet you, Andrew. Maybe we can help each other.

A - Yes, that is the idea. Glad to meet you, too, David. See you soon.
