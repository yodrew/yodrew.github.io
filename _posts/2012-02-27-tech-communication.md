Very off-topic note about how I have come to think of long periods of silence and repeated non-responses in text communication with computer technicians. When it happens I assume one of the following:

  * the issue:
    * was addressed before
    * is so basic I should already know about it
    * is easy enough in their minds for me to work out on my own
  * they don't know
  * they would like to but can't
  * they aren't interested
  * the answer is no

As long as my message contained no interesting requests or instructions, why would they respond? It's like a logic circuit. Or, at least, my idea of one.

I have read forums. There is simply too much data to respond to. One must not suffer fools or welcome the cloying "friendship" of a zillion strangers.

It took me awhile, but I'd like to think I get it. Here's to the techs. I'm on your side. Thank you for making computers happen.
