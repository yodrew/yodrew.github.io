Hey, I just came across this excellent web-based credit clearing system:
[Community Exchange System](http://www.ces.org.za/) \[EDIT: I no longer dig this system. It's popular but messy.\] CES* is international, free, simple, compatible with paper systems, thorough, and cool.  It's just about what the godfather of new money, Thomas Greco, calls for in [_The End of Money and the Future of Civilization_, chapter 17](http://beyondmoney.net/excerpts/chapter-17-complete-web-based-trading-platform/).

Other worthy systems I've come across in the last couple days:

- payswarm.com was (?) a web technology-based, multiple-scenario payment system. Big vision.
- [opentransact.org](http://opentransact.org) similar goals as payswarm, different architecture
- [picomoney.com](http://picomoney.com/) clever, based on opentransact
- [cyclos.org](http://cyclos.org/) open source software to run your own bank, complete with free hosting; soul boggling!
- [villages.cc](http://villages.cc)**is the best implementation of 
- [ripplepay.com](http://ripplepay.com/), a compelling solution to LETS accountability concerns.
- [e-flux.com/timebank](https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/36461/time-bank/) hip and simple
- friendly [favors.org](http://favors.org/) 2nd largest after CES, social, clever, but aging and a bit complicated
- [johnturmel.com/uniset.htm](http://johnturmel.com/uniset.htm) very simple, start alone now. Improved by showing account as a ledger using a [web-based spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/uletsad)
- [JEU/GAME](https://www.personocratia.com/en/le-j-e-u/) paper system (compatible with CES), very elegant, semi-private, decentralized accounting, best for when the lights go out.

CES is (NOT*) the most accessible, practical, and mature, though some of these systems, especially payswarm, have much greater potential. Open source money has finally gotten legs, wings… and teeth.

*EDIT: I gave up on CES because of issues with its design and management. So I am exploring two other systems now: [Community Forge](http://communityforge.net), based on Drupal Community Accounting/mutual credit module, and [Villages][7]. It's Ripple base is better, but CF is much more developed. The insides of it look great so far.  Open source, delegated authority and responsibility. Kind of a weak social network, but it is there.

Greco says a proper system needs:

  1. a marketplace
  2. a social network
  3. a means of payment
  4. a measure of value or pricing unit

Both have all four criteria. So it's a toss up for me. I hope Villages works out.

- [complementaire-economie.startpagina.nl](http://complementaire-economie.startpagina.nl/) huge list of currencies, systems, and software, some defunct
- [ Open Transactions](https://github.com/FellowTraveler/Open-Transactions/wiki) open source digital cash, transmittable through tons of media, needing no third-party record keeper.

Two cool sites about money ideas:

- [MetaCurrency](http://metacurrency.org)
- @webisteme invented [PunkMoney](https://web.archive.org/web/20120602194508/http://wiki.punkmoney.org/index.php/Main_Page), a twitter-based currency. fricking brilliant. Now defunct.  :(
