Well, I got [my first incoming link](http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/2008/03/20/digestion-selected-for-docility/) today* from [entitled to an opinion](http://entitledtoanopinion.wordpress.com/), a droll, well-written blog on contemporary social and political issues. The author just wanted an ad-free copy of [Origins of Agriculture](/f/origins/) by Greg Wadley and Angus Martin and found one here. Random, but strangely exciting.

\[*edit: in fact, this link occurred 1 1/2 years ago; I only just _noticed_ it now that I'm using wordpress. Before, I just had a static html website and zero awareness of things like incoming links. Now, with WordPress, I'm starting to learn to manage this site properly. Thanks, TGGP.\]
