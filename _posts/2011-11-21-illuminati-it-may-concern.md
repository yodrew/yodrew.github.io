Dear Illuminati,

I believe that you are trying to handle our collective mess the best way you know how. Every day you wake up to the responsibility of managing billions of people who can't handle things themselves. Your activities for millennia have maintained this absurd situation, but what option did you have? 

I think that some of you really like this system of slavery and want to intensify it. But most of you dislike it and would do something else if you could. You feel as trapped as we do. It is a terrible problem. How to solve it peacefully?

For a long time, I thought that you were my enemy. Hatred and sadness about your activities consumed me. But now, as a result of my long search for understanding, I am extending both forgiveness and the offer of a way to handle our situation differently.

Since this subject is your main interest, please read my [book](/). Then write me if you would like to help make this deep way of healing possible for yourselves. I could use your help. You could probably use a break. And working together would be a pleasant change from our previous estrangement.

I have found a way through our conflict that makes a place for **everyone** at the end, especially you whom many slaves would wish to exclude (if not summarily execute). In my opinion, you are hurt by all this worst of all. I believe the way I have found would serve your requirements. I really believe there is a place for all of us, even you.

Welcome.

Sincerely,  
Andrew Durham
