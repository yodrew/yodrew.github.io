[NOTE: this is a note on compost that almost made it into my book. It is meant to allay any concerns and provide more details regarding the [toilet](/water#toilet) designs.

I have traveled for decades among hippies, permaculturists, organic farmers, and professional self-sufficiency experts. The composting system I liked the most was in a guy's suburban backyard. It was three plywood bins under an awning. Two, lined with plastic, with hinged lids, were 1 m<sup>3</sup>. One in the middle, about half as wide, held plant debris.

We emptied 20L buckets of poop and food scraps into one of the big ones. We covered it with debris each time and  wiped out the buckets with debris. 

Mixing food scraps with the poop made it legal. It only smelled while emptying a bucket. Waste is proteinaceous. Debris is carbonaceous. They combine rapidly to make humus, the black fertile component of soil. It happens by chemical reaction, microbes, and enzymes, and fungi and worms from outside.

When the bin was full, he would seal it off for about a year. He would empty the other, spreading it onto the yard and garden. Then we would start filling it.

It's nearly impossible to screw up compost. There are a million ways to do it. I liked this system because of its overall simplicity and adaptability. It is cheap and approachable. It just worked. I saw plenty of fancy, complicated systems that smelled or required regular maintenance. Who needs that?

Some systems are solid state, require no handling of raw waste or maintenance except emptying the perfect compost. Decomposition occurs inside. They are big, expensive, and require two floors in the building.

I met a guy who had gotten a degree in ecology. He did his senior thesis on compost. He found that  only one soft or liquid substance in a typical American home cannot be composted: chlorine bleach. It is a persistent toxin. It kills life wherever it goes and for a long time. (It simply should not be used. Color-safe bleach (sodium percarbonate) works well and is non-toxic. Regular cleaners are sufficient elsewhere.)

Everything else---detergents, pesticides, motor oil, expired medication---will break down. Any complication you ever hear about compost is simply false. Citrus and banana peels are fine, even meat scraps as long as they are covered immediately with plant debris. High temperature is unnecessary (it actually means: add more carbon). Whatever it may be, compost it.
