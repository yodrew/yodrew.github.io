At my request, xda developer, verygreen, with support from ros87, has done in 24 hours for $10 and a $109 donated device what tens of companies could/would not do in four years with all their resources (like the $500,000 one company told me it would cost).

Watch him type on the Nook Simple Touch on youtube:
[Nook Simple Touch usb host support](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU3RpK4LEuk)

EDIT: for outline of installation instructions, see:[Installation Wiki](http://forum.xda-developers.com/wiki/BN_Nook_Simple_Touch/USB_host_mode)
These are at noob-hacker level.

There are still some bugs, and the instructions are over my head at this point \[EDIT: not anymore--see wiki link above\]. But the basics are there now for people who know how to use them. Once the bugs are worked out, I plan to simplify the instructions for everyone's use. Maybe even offer microSD cards with everything pre-installed. \[EDIT: this plan is off my agenda for the time being.\]

Here we go.
