Here is a poem I read at age 17. It prefaces one of my favorite books, _Magical Child Matures_ by Joseph Chilton Pearce. It took all this time to start seeing the meaning. If ever there were a poem of rapture, this is it.

#### If I Could Only Live at the Pitch That is Near Madness

Richard Eberhart

If I could only live at the pitch that is near madness  
When everything is as it was in my childhood  
Violent, vivid, and of infinite possibility:  
That the sun and the moon broke over my head.

Then I cast time out of the trees and fields.  
Then I stood immaculate in the Ego;  
Then I eyed the world with all delight,  
Reality was the perfection of my sight.

And time has big handles on the hands,  
Fields and trees a way of being themselves.  
I saw battalions of the race of mankind  
Standing solid, demanding a moral answer.

I gave the moral answer and I died  
And into a realm of complexity came  
Where nothing is possible but necessity  
And the truth wailing there like a red babe.
