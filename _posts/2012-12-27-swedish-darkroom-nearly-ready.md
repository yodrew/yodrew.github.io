The darkroom we have been building in Skattungbyn, Sweden is nearly ready. We are putting the finishing touches on the nifty [fiwihex](http://viking-house.ie/fine-wire-hrv.html) ventilation system today and will test it before the weekend is out. We will test and refine it with local supporters in January and open it to the public in February. You can see a calendar for it on the [register](/prepare/) page.
