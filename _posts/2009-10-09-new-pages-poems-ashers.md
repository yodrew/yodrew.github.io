I have made two new pages of some older writings: my [poems](/other-writings/poems) from 1992 to the present and a short memoir, [The Ashers, a River, and I](/other-writings/ashers) of a canoe trip I took as a boy with the Boy Scouts, my Scoutmaster, Jack Asher, and his wife, LaVerne, which I wrote for their 50th Wedding Anniversary.
