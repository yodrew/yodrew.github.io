#### recover your lost self

Switch off the world. Sleep again. Heal from _everything_.

Including trauma. Healing from it feels like a miracle. Lost parts of oneself return. One becomes whole again.

Darkness does nothing. It is just a condition. What life does in darkness is the miracle.

Consciously, you rest and maintain the conditions of rest. Unconsciously, your organism exponentially increases its work to heal itself, in body and soul.

From health comes joy, power, genius: the abilities we need to restore the world and live full lives in it.

Everything else can wait. Recovering your lost self cannot wait.
 
#### what it is 

A hygienic darkroom retreat is an extended rest in a totally dark room. The room is quiet, comfortable, and well-ventilated. There is food. One is alone, with supporters nearby.

This is a complete manual, with theory, protocol, and design. It explains why retreating works and how to do it. It includes instructions and blueprints for beginning at home.

#### toward a hygienic psychology

This approach to darkness is _hygienic_. It is neither spiritual, therapeutic, nor psychedelic. 

Look it up. More than cleanliness, hygiene is the science of health, a branch of biology. It is based on life's self-preserving and conditional nature. Hygiene (not medicine) led the 19th century's huge improvements in public health.

Hygiene lacked only a psychology and way to deal with trauma. These prove to be the keys to health. The result: reliable miracles.
