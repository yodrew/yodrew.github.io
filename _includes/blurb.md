### recover your lost self

Switch off the world. Sleep again. Heal from _everything_.

Darkness is no miracle. It is a normal condition of life. What life does with darkness is the miracle.

Consciously, your job is to stay in it. Maintain the conditions of profound rest. Unconsciously, the organism goes to work healing itself, body and soul. Lost parts of the self return.

From health---wholeness---comes joy, power, genius: the capacities we need to restore the world and live full lives in it.

Everything else can wait. Recovering your lost self cannot wait.

#### concretes

A hygienic darkroom retreat is an extended rest in a totally dark room. The room is quiet, comfortable, and well-ventilated. There is food. One is alone, with supporters nearby. 

This is a complete manual, with theory, protocol, and design. It explains why retreating works and how to do it. It includes instructions and blueprints for beginning at home.

#### toward a hygienic psychology

This approach to darkness is _hygienic_. It is neither spiritual, therapeutic, nor psychedelic. 

Look it up. More than cleanliness, hygiene is the science of health, a branch of biology. It is based on life's self-preserving and conditional nature. Starting two centuries ago, hygiene—not medicine—led to the 19th century's huge improvements in public health.

Hygiene lacked only a psychology and way to deal with trauma. These prove to be the keys to health and darkness. The result: reliable miracles.
