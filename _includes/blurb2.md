A _hygienic darkroom retreat_ is extended rest in total darkness. Healing super-intensifies. Energy and function are restored. Clarity, strength, and joy reappear. The lost self returns.

This complete manual explains why a retreat works, how to do it, and how to make a darkroom at home. It shows that miracles are easy. Simply provide their conditions.

##### toward a hygienic psychology

Indigenous and spiritual traditions have used physical darkness for millennia. This is the first approach to darkness---and psychology---based on hygiene. Not just cleanliness, hygiene is the _science of health_, a branch of biology. Hygiene recognizes the self-preserving nature of life and its normal conditions. These include fresh air, ample sleep, pure food, frequent bathing and exercise, etc. Darkness enables the full application of hygiene to the organic system of the psyche.

Hygiene began to show nature's way to industrial civilization in 1832. Worldwide massive improvements in public health followed. Its benefits continue for billions who don't even know the word... and never see doctors. Hygiene is historyâ€™s most influential approach to health. 

The primary condition of healing is profound rest. All its conditions exist in a hygienic darkroom retreat, perfected and temporarily extended, as in fasting. The psyche heals itself autonomically of even the greatest injuries. The result: reliable miracles.
