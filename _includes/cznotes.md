##### media

Paper or e-paper is best for reading. Print a paper copy, or buy one: ([write](/back/services#write)). 8" or 10" e-paper devices from established companies are good. Dasung or Onyx monitors are best for writing and working.

Avoid backlit screens for reading: computers, tablets, phones. They irritate the eyes, disrupt concentration, and lower comprehension.
