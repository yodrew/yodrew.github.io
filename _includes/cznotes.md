##### media

Paper or e-paper is best for reading. Print a paper copy, or buy one: ([write](/back/services#write)). An 8" or 10" e-paper device from an established company will do. The Dasung or Onyx monitors are best for writing and working.

Avoid backlit screens: computers, tablets, phones. They irritate the eyes, disrupt concentration, and lower comprehension.
