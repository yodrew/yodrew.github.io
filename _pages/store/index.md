### why, how, what

I do what I do to provide a way to recover our lost selves, so that we can restore the world to its original splendor and live full lives in it. 

I search nature for ways to accomplish this. She shows me, and I develop them into simple means anyone can use.

I wrote a book about the main one: the means she provides us to heal from trauma, the cause of our painful losses. I also offer this means as a service.

How about it?

### retreat

- [confer](./confer): benefit the most from retreating by understanding the hygienic approach. Have me check your [questionnaire](/prepare#questionnaire) for comprehension of my book and discuss it with you by phone. It is the first step to retreating with me. Improve the experience and results of retreating on your own, as well.
- [enroll](./enroll) for a retreat with me, either here or at your place. Unleash the invincible power of your self-healing organism by providing it the best possible conditions to rest and heal.

I will respond in detail, by phone, email or messenger app, to all your questions and concerns about:

### design-build

I design and build darkrooms in existing buildings as part of supporting retreats. 

I improve the design of any new building or remodel intended for retreating.

From scratch, I build my own designs and those with the same or better qualities. See my [hygienic house](/plan) for some of my latest thinking. A vaulted mobile shelter is also in the works. 

$50/hr.

I plan to manufacture all my designs as well as jigs and tools for others to make them in a distributed fashion. Let me know if you have an interest in this.
