To benefit the most from a hygienic darkroom retreat, you must know how to do one. Knowledge comes from reading and comprehending my book about it. 

I can help make sure you understand it. Send me your completed questionnaire from the [prepare](/prepare#questionnaire) chapter of my book. I will review it then talk to you by phone about it.

You have probably grasped the basic idea but may have missed some details. I will point them out. They will enable you to notice subtle opportunities in darkness.

They will also illuminate incorrect assumptions or conditioning that can trip you up in darkness. You need not try to change them, only remember. Then you will be better prepared when they surface in your retreat.

Use the form below. Or [copy](/prepare#questionnaire), paste, and complete the questionnaire in an email to me, [paying here](/store#pay).
