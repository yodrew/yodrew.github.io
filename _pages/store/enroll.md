Enroll below for a hygienic darkroom retreat with me as supporter.

Retreat at my place in America or yours anywhere the USA has good relations.

A retreat lasts 11 days. It is a [9-day Czech](/format#czech) retreat + [2 buffer](/format#extra) days. I offer one retreat per month. Choose a month now and dates within it later.

### price

- my place: $4400

### process

The process is more involved than usual. It lets us get to know each other and begin working together. It shows each of us the other's reliability and ability to follow instructions. Sympathy and trust develop. All this is critical to a successful retreat with me. I aim for us to succeed.
