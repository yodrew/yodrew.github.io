In civilization, we are over-stimulated and distressed. We need relief.

We are exhausted and depressed. We need rest and recovery.

We are hurt and sick. We need healing.

How? By _hygienic darkroom retreating_: profound rest for the self-healing organism. It is a rational approach. It is nature's solution to suffering. In darkness, one switches off the world, with its noise and demands. One takes refuge in the deep self, supporting one's organism in healing itself by itself. This book is the complete manual for understanding and doing it. 

### basics

#### how it works

1. The psyche, as an organic system, is self-healing.
2. The primary condition of healing is profound rest. 
3. The most profound psychic rest occurs in extended total darkness _as a physiological response_

Because the process of healing is automatic, it is foolproof. The psyche needs darkness for rest like lungs need air for breathing and eyes need light for seeing. It knows no substitute. Healing happens involuntarily---by itself---when we voluntarily provide ourselves with sufficient conditions of rest. This is fully developed in [secret](/darkroom-retreat#secret). It is contextualized in [hygienic psychology](/psychology#hygienic-psychology).

Through abstract theory and concrete practice, this book tells how to provide all the conditions of rest in perfect proportion. Most importantly, it introduces the passive, hygienic _attitude_ toward healing. Merely knowing it opens the door to super-intensified healing, ie, miracles. When you are ready, you can walk through it. 

The book reveals what healing requires in detail. It inspires you to heal and to support others in doing so. It includes designs for darkroom components. Their precision enables even amateur craftsmen to get them right.

#### requirements

To retreat, one needs three things: knowledge, materials, and support.

- knowledge:
	- of hygienic theory
	- of the practice of hygienic darkroom retreating
- materials 
	- darkroom
	- food
	- personal belongings
- support
	- supporters are knowledgeable: have read this book, possibly [Shelton's](/f/hygiene.pdf)
	- experienced: have done at least a [5-day](/format#5-day) retreat
	- sympathetic, protective of himself and retreater

		Hygiene is the basis on which sick people can help each other without making things worse. Our problem is partly social. It is solved with increasing degrees of cooperation as we become more capable of doing so.

Meet these requirements by reading this book, preparing for a retreat, and retreating. 

Your first retreats are gratifying warm-ups. You will get relief, sleep, and healing like you never thought possible. You will feel the meaning of hygienic ideas. You will get good at retreating. Then you will be prepared for the ultra-effective medium and long retreats.

##### darkroom

A darkroom is a bedroom, suite, or house that is perfectly dark. Sealing a room like this often requires additional ventilation measures. A darkroom can be basic or deluxe. To summarize the practical point of this book, I advocate making basic darkness in your bedroom now, and arranging for deluxe darkness in another location later. 

Basic darkness means perfectly dark, well-ventilated, reasonably quiet, and comfortable. This provides darkness for nightly sleep; a place to familiarize yourself with extended darkness at your own pace; and a place for your first short retreats.

Deluxe darkness adds extra features, comforts, and space. A dedicated darkroom is built in a small fully functional house in a quiet location. Like all houses should be but are not, it is perfectly and easily darkened. More in [design](/design).

#### terminology

##### glossary

hygiene
: [Gr. _Hygieia_, goddess and personification of health)
1 - the science of health, a branch of biology.
2 - caring for health by respecting life's self-preserving nature and providing its normal conditions.
3 - hygienism; Natural Hygiene

Take a moment. Pull out 2-3 dictionaries. Look it up for yourself. Some do not even mention cleanliness.

Natural Hygiene
: the two-century-old school of health that exemplifies and champions hygiene (as distinguished from the medically reduced view of hygiene as mere cleanliness)

normal
: what is biologically appropriate (not merely usual or average)

psyche
: the faculty of knowing, specifically of man, including:

	-  intelligence:  form / center / functions / association
		- moving: sensation / gut / physical, instinct / reptilian  
		- feeling: perception / heart / emotional, intuition / mammalian
		- thinking: conception / brain / mental, intellect / rational
	- parts (used as both adjectives and nouns)
		- unconscious: coordinates processes fundamental to life like metabolism, cell division, and blood oxygen levels. It cannot become conscious or directly controlled except to an insignificant or backfiring degree, through intense yogic practices, techniques like hypnosis or biofeedback, or psychoactive substances. Synonyms: autonomic, involuntary
		- subconscious: acquired automatized knowledge, which can be made conscious, like walking, emotional associations, cognizing words, and dreaming
		- conscious: ordinary waking awareness, as when reading this book or running an errand. Primarily used to direct attention. Synonyms: will or volition
	- scales
		- cell
		- tissue
		- organ
		- system
		- the organism as a whole

psychic
:	of or relating to the psyche in general (not occult powers).  
&nbsp; &nbsp; For example, I refer to psychic illness rather than "mental" illness. Psychology is not just the study of the mind, but the psyche: the entire human faculty of knowing. This includes emotional and physical aspects not reducible to the mental one (try as the priests of our intellectually obsessed lifeway might to make it seem otherwise).

lifeway
:	a way of life; everything that happens with people in a given group in the course of living.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; I once used the word, culture, for this. Then my neighbor, [John Zerzan](https://johnzerzan.net), explained to me that culture is recent: an aspect of civilization. I wanted a single word that would include all approaches to man's existence. Lifeway compresses the phrase "way of life" into one word. It is common in anthropology.

##### usage

I don't use neologisms. I don't use words in any special sense. A dictionary will clear up any confusion you may have while reading. Read through the senses and the etymology as well.

My usage is sometimes uncommon. I take pains to recover the original or essential meanings of words by digging into etymology and historical usage. Bad philosophical influences, manipulation by elites, and sloppy popular usage constantly degrade the meanings of high-level abstractions. Words become corrupt or acquire unfortunate associations. Language is artificial and must be maintained.

I consider this half the job of intellectuals. The Oxford English Dictionary exemplifies this effort. I used to jot down words to look up in it on my next visit to the library. Pre-1970 editions of American Heritage Dictionary and Webster's are excellent dictionaries in single volumes.

Beware of newer lexicology. Idealism dominates intellectuals. Its radical irrationality has corrupted English. I mean the modern heirs of Plato and Kant: Bernays, Adorno, Mao (political correctness), Marcuse, etc.

### background

#### nature

Darkness is instinctive. We sleep in it at night and nap in shadows. We use our hands to cover our eyes when overwhelmed. When injured or sick, we take longer refuge in caves and shelters. We and many other animals always have. 

Absolute darkness is natural. Our natural habitat is tropical forest. At night its floor is pitch black.

#### traditions

Spiritual traditions have used darkness for millennia. They tend to view it as the ultimate environment for self-discipline and gaining unusual knowledge. Egyptians and Maya have used it in pyramids; Christians in catacombs; Sufis and Taoists in caves; Tibetan Buddhists in cells of monasteries.

Indigenous traditions do likewise: Amazonian shamanism uses darkness in ayahuasca ceremony. Welsh shamans and Navajo, Maya, and Kogi Indians build special dark structures. They hold darkness in high regard as essential to self-discovery. They also use caves for healing. 

Western science has studied sensory destimulation since the 1950s for astronautics, health, and mind-control. Ayurveda, India's ancient healing tradition, uses extended periods of darkness for rejuvenation. By [reports](/report/365-day-yogi), a darkroom retreat is nothing less than the fountain of youth.

Unfortunately, the partially or completely active nature of these approaches to darkroom retreating compromises them. They depend on an active will, the faculty most in need of rest.

Hygiene is passive, allowing the distressed will to finally rest and recover. Hygiene depends on the autonomic self---omniscient, omnipotent, and infallible---to accomplish the work of healing. This removes structural conflict in the method, promising [limitless](/blog/2011/05/limitless) results. 

Hygiene completely secularizes the use of darkness for the specific purpose of healing. There is nothing mystical, disciplined, or complicated about this approach. It is rational, safe, and natural, leading to reliable miracles.

#### hygiene

Medicine led us to believe hygiene is just cleanliness (see [history](/hygiene#history)). In fact, hygiene deals with all aspects of health scientifically. Any good dictionary proves this. Hygiene is broad and deep. 

The word is common because of _Natural Hygiene_. It is a radical school of natural health originating in America in 1822. It led the global natural health movement of the 19th century.

Hygiene respects the self-preserving nature of life. It observes that organisms both maintain and recover health under normal conditions of life. So it studies organic self-preservation and how to provide its conditions.

Normal conditions of life include fresh air, sunlight, natural food, work, friendship, and cleanliness by regular bathing. Hygiene taught the modern world the enormous benefits of these simple, free, natural, pleasant influences. This significantly raised health standards worldwide. Its motto is "Health through healthful living". It has only lacked a psychology and an appreciation for trauma as the cause of all illness; this book corrects that.

Hygiene identifies disease **_as_** the process of healing. Disease is the normal organic activity of repair, elimination, and re-energizing, but distressed by abnormal conditions. Thus, disease is not an invading entity to be fought. It is a beneficial process to support by restoring healthy conditions and practices. It is a set of clues to precisely guide this caregiving.

The fundamentals of hygiene help us reconnect with our own common sense about healing. They guide us past incorrect assumptions we likely have about it. First, learn these absolute basics. Then you can learn the concrete details of a darkroom retreat and approach it with confidence. Moreover, hygiene provides guidance in all aspects of healthful living.

#### people

My parents had taught me the importance of eating well through their interest in natural diet. When I was 9 years old, I got sick and realized it was from the junk food I had eaten the day before. Diet became my religion for 30 years.

Natural Hygiene came knocking three times. The first time was in 1989 through my dad's second wife, Jennifer Justice. She was a truthseeker with scores of fascinating books. Among them I found the ecstatic _Fit for Life_ by Harvey and Marilyn Diamond. 

It knocked again in 1992 through a great friend, Sterling Voss. In the greatest letter anyone ever wrote me, he told me about _Fasting Can Save Your Life_ by Herbert Shelton, hygiene's systematizer. 

It knocked a final time in 2001, through friend and colleague, Frederic Patenaude. He was the editor of _Just Eat An Apple_ magazine and author of _The Raw Secrets_. These publications were about the raw vegan diet. This time, I opened the door.

##### frederic

I met [Frederic Patenaude](https://fredericpatenaude.com) in San Diego at a raw food potluck. We found we helped each other get things done. We became housemates and coworkers for a total of three years off and on from 1998 till 2003. We worked at Nature's First Law in California; Tree of Life Center in Arizona; and at his new office in Quebec.

Frederic had started in hygiene with the works French hygienic master, Albert Mosseri. Frederic read all his 20+ books and was in contact with him till his death in 2012.

Slowly, I absorbed the essence of Natural Hygiene's radical perspective through conversations with Frederic. By this, I mean he got it through my thick skull with his calm, relentless, crystalline arguments. I was challenging but sympathetic, so I kept asking. He kept answering.

It took time because I started out confused. A mess of alternative dietary ideas floated around my head since childhood. Fortunately, I was committed to logic. The rationality and simplicity of hygiene made it finally click. I started studying it on my own.

Frederic's dedication and great knowledge made him immovable where I was merely stubborn. I am grateful to him for this.

I can only hope to return the favor with the current work. It illuminates certain mysteries of diet that frustrated us. Like why some people stick with eating healthy food and others don't (see [capacity](/hygiene#capacity)). And the greater mystery of metaphysical suffering that we, like so many others, failed to solve with diet.

##### purna

Purna Steinitz was my guru for several years between 2000-2008. I first heard about darkroom retreating in 2004 from him. An American Hindu, he had heard about its use in Ayurveda. He told me, "Apparently, after a few weeks of it, one comes out completely renewed."

The idea struck me as strange. The well-lit Apollonian upper world of spirituality attracted me most. As a budding hygienist, I thought we needed _light_. But like a lot of earthy things Purna said, the idea of renewal in darkness stayed with me. 

I also learned from him the ideas of capacity, function, and how one's results come from how one is being. As with darkness and grace, I have extricated them from the spiritual context and put them into the more profitable biological one of this book.

##### harold

A year later, I moved to an ecovillage in Oregon. I met the village maintenance man. I'll call him Harold. He actually had a darkroom.

He had inspired the village's youth to try darkness. After listening to him about it that winter, I did, too.

[Wow](/report/five-darkness-experiences).

But as Harold liked to say, I was just getting started. It would take two more years, the shock of leaving my guru, and another successful retreat for me to grasp the significance of retreating in darkness.

Harold and I would part company later, but he showed me what would become my work in this life.

##### andrew

How did all this begin?

My parents were thinkers and somewhat unconventional. They were much concerned with philosophy, health, design, and music. I took all of it more seriously than they expected. 

They were emotionally distant. My intense [older brother](http://pauldurham.com) became a big force in my life. For me, our house was more training camp than home. Other [influences](/back/bibliography-influences/) and [people](/back/acknowledgments/) smoothed it out a bit.

I felt awed by life at 2, joyful at 3. School started and a part of me went comatose.

By age 15, I felt morose and alienated. But something from childhood was stirring in me. One day, I slumped before the TV. A tiny woman living inside it mentioned the importance of loving oneself and being happy. If my mood was the Death Star, this advice was Luke Skywalker's photon torpedo.

In a moment, I was overcome by [rapture](/conjecture/rapture): sublime joy in apprehending our perfect, beautiful universe. The feeling was bigger than at age 3. It lasted three months. When it faded, so did my previous interests. More than anything, I wanted to understand the cause of joy. I wanted it back. 

In elementary school, I had read _The Dark Is Rising_ by Susan Cooper. It left an intriguing impression.

During my rapture, I found _Do You Really Need Eyeglasses?_ about natural care of the eyes with exercises, sunning, and palming. By palming, I found "the field": the dark screen behind covered eyes on which the imagination plays best. I came to rely on it for rest and solace, too. Twenty-three years later, I realized this book was hygienic in origin when I read the chapter on care of the eyes in Shelton's masterwork.

My father's hero, Frank Lloyd Wright, gave me a way to escape school after graduation. "Better four years of experience than four more years of education," he said. That was all I needed. I never looked back.

I finished high school—barely. I started traveling and [living out](https://warmlite.com) of a [backpack](https://mchalepacks.com). For 21 years, I independently investigated the cause of joy. I used my legacy: the philosophy, hygiene, and design my parents had taught me. I did my first darkroom retreat. Two years later, in 2008, the answer came:

>_A slight increase of vital energy from adolescence had caused a temporary, partial restoration of my damaged psychic integrity, revealing the perfection and beauty of the universe, which was enrapturing. So a massive increase from profound rest in darkness would cause permanent and complete restoration._

With this breakthrough, my search ended. Development began, starting with testing. Besides myself, 28 clients have tried it. Their results echoed my early ones.

Over the course of my 27 retreats of 2--7 days, noticeable restoration of my psychic integrity and function has occurred. My body's scent has improved. I regained some access to my long-buried sexuality. From one retreat, I woke up feeling like an adult for the first time in 41 years. This feeling has never left me. Alongside my childish panic in the face of challenges, an adult now steadily thinks through them. 

In retreat, symptoms of fibromyalgia dissipate. Aches and pains dissolve. Flexibility returns. I wake up _just knowing_ things that had always stumped me. Issues that dogged me for decades resolve themselves. Insomnia, exhaustion, and suicidality evaporate. Clarity, energy, ease, and purpose return for weeks at a time. I naturally exercise, like a cat or a child. Basic functioning lasts two months after just a short retreat. All these things come after years or decades without them.

In all these small miracles, I have sensed far greater ones await in darkness. I gained invincible hope, the will to persist, and a more precise compass for finding my way.

Besides this and other supporting evidence, told in greater detail in my [retreat reports](/report), no data contradicting the basic idea has yet emerged. Meanwhile, interest in darkness is growing worldwide. 

In Europe, I met a renowned professor of psychology and researcher in REST (Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy). This is the academic approach to both flotation and dark retreating. She unqualifiedly agreed with my theory of psychophysical healing. She proposed research with my exact method, once I had a darkroom. I was not ready and could not arrange it, but it was a good sign.

Wherever I go, people are as struck by the logic of hygiene and darkness as I am. They want to try a retreat.

### application

#### audience

This book is for the:

- hygienic darkroom retreater. Knowledge of hygiene enables trust in and care for life. Then miracles of healing can happen.
- truthseeker like me. See for yourself if I found some. I'd like to save you some time. Maybe you, not I, will get us across the line. Whatever it takes.
- sufferer, who needs hope and a real way to stop the pain, be it metaphysical, mental, emotional, physical, social, or ecological
- normal man, who is functional, reasonable, positive, and busy; who knows there is more to life than The Program; but only has evenings, weekends and vacations in which to explore further
- self-experimenter, who feels yearning, curiosity, wonder, or a wish to find his next step
- servant, who wishes to know why mankind is in such rough shape and what to do about it
- academic, who appreciates new ideas, good arguments, and reasonable tests for them
- hygienist, who senses hygiene's unrealized potential 
- whatever you may be, you who detect something of import here

Hygienic darkroom retreating is for anyone to whom it makes sense and who feels moved to do it, whether to heal from acute illness or just see what it's like. 

Chronic physical illness originates in trauma. Trauma heals in darkness. Then the organism becomes able to heal the illness, sometimes concurrently. Do not underestimate the power of the self-healing organism in darkness. 

Darkness is not an escape. It suits everyone, but not necessarily right now. Sometimes illness or problems need to be addressed in more pressing and obvious ways first. Hygiene offers many means to do so. Keep one eye open for this possibility. 

Learning about hygiene through darkroom retreating reveals hygiene's scope like nothing else. It helps one understand the basic processes of health in a complete context of body _and_ soul. It shows where one is in the process of healing. It offers encouragement and hope. It puts things in perspective. Familiarity with hygiene is critical to healing from any illness. To this end, Herbert Shelton's [*Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene*](/f/hygiene.pdf)\* is essential reading.

#### how to use this book

Above all, this book presents an idea for consideration. For now, doing a retreat is not at issue. To do something like this, you must want to. To want to, you must believe in it. To believe, you must know about it. So first, learn the idea if it interests you. Invest your energy in gaining knowledge by reading every word of this book, cover to cover. Once it makes sense to you, rational belief will form. Motivation naturally follows.

Then use this as a manual for making basic darkness for yourself at home. Download the companion darkroom retreat [zip file](/darkroom-retreat.zip). It has all the plans for components as well as some reference work on hygiene. 

Help from others may or may not come. You are the one you have been waiting for. The need for self-reliance applies to darkness more than anything else I've ever been involved with. I have had to recover enough of a self to rely on, and to find remnants of it I didn't know I had. But, "a little here, a little there", the task is being accomplished.

The full application of the idea of hygienic darkroom retreating consists of doing retreats of increasing length, alternated with making radical changes in lifeway. In darkness, one becomes capable of them. They include studying and applying the rest of hygiene. Continue this two-part program until your psychic and physical health are completely restored. _Live_.
