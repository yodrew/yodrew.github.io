This book is best read front to back, word upon word. Each paragraph builds upon the last. The thesis is presented immediately in brief, then in increasing detail.

The book is an integrated whole. Every word aids comprehension, including front and back elements (preface, faq, etc).

##### media

Paper or e-paper is best for reading. Print a paper copy from this pdf. Or buy one (see [write](/back/services#write)). 8" or 10" e-paper devices from established companies are good. Dasung or Onyx monitors are best for writing and working.

Avoid backlit screens for reading: computers, tablets, phones. They irritate the eyes, disrupt concentration, and lower comprehension.
