This book is best read front to back, word upon word. Each paragraph builds upon the last. The thesis is presented immediately in brief, then in increasing detail. 

The book is an integrated whole. Every word aids comprehension, including front matter, dedication, blurb, etc.

This book has links. They are:

- colored on the web
- underlined in the ebook and paper book

Readers of paper books can follow crosslinks: links within the book. They have a number or letter after them, in parentheses. For example, [capacity](/hygiene#capacity) (1) or [services](/back/services) (w). Simply open to the corresponding chapter/element and skim the headings for the linked word.

#### media

Paper or e-paper is best for reading.

Paper copies available. See [write](/back/services#write).

I recommend any of the 6", 8", and 10" e-paper devices by established companies for reading. The Dasung 13.3" monitor is best for writing.

Avoid reading on backlit color screens (computers, tablets, phones). They disrupt concentration, lowering comprehension.

#### latest

I continue to make significant improvements and corrections to the book and plans. Always get the latest version when rereading or making components:

- web: [darkroomretreat.com](/) 
- ebook (pdf, epub, mobi): [leanpub.com/darkroomretreat](https://leanpub.com/darkroomretreat) (Please subscribe to updates in your library on Leanpub.)
- plans: [darkroom-retreat.zip](/darkroom-retreat.zip)

<!-- or find all links without referencing the ebook or my website: - [external links](#links) are listed at the very end of the book by chapter -->
