This book is best read front to back, word upon word. Each paragraph builds upon the last. The thesis is presented immediately in brief, then in increasing detail. 

The book is an integrated whole. Every word aids comprehension, including front matter, dedication, blurb, etc.

##### links

Colored or underlined words are links. When also *italicized*, they link to books. If *asterisked*\*, the book is free to download or read online.

[External link addresses](#links) are listed at the end of the book by chapter or element (like a chapter, but in the front or back of the book).

A number or letter after a link refers to a chapter or element within the book. Look there for link text atop a section. Examples: [capacity](/hygiene#capacity) _-1_ links to the capacity section in chapter 1, hygiene. [Media](/front/notes#media) _-b_ links to:

##### media

Paper or e-paper is best for reading. Paper copies available. See [write](/back/services#write). I recommend any of the 6", 8", and 10" e-paper devices by established companies for reading. The Dasung 13.3" monitor is best for writing.

Avoid reading on backlit color screens (computers, tablets, phones). They disrupt concentration, lowering comprehension.
