This book is best read front to back, word upon word. Each paragraph builds upon the last. The thesis is presented immediately in brief, then in increasing detail.

The book is an integrated whole. Every word aids comprehension, including front and back elements (preface, faq, etc).

##### links

- [colored](/) words are links<!--notes-->
- [*italicized*](https://foodnsport.com) links are book titles
- if also [*asterisked*](/f/hygiene.pdf)\*, book is free to download or read online

##### media

Paper or e-paper is best for reading. Print a paper copy from this pdf. Or buy one (see [write](/back/services#write)). 8" or 10" e-paper devices from established companies are good. Dasung or Onyx monitors are best for writing and working.

Avoid backlit screens for reading: computers, tablets, phones. They irritate the eyes, disrupt concentration, and lower comprehension.

#### the recovery of joy

This book comes out of a long inquiry into the cause of joy. 

At 15, out of the blue, great joy overcame me. The moment blossomed into hours, days, months. Joy was real. It was natural. It was _normal._

Then it disappeared. _Why_? The need gripped me to solve this mystery. After a long investigation, I did.*

The solution included a way to recover joy. Freud had identified the destroyer of joy: trauma. I discovered the essential condition nature provides us to heal from trauma: darkness, used restfully.

Joy comes from health, not achievement or acquisition. It comes from being, not doing or having. It is the feeling of being fully alive. It means all is well with oneself.

Lack of joy---suffering---comes from damage from trauma. Given profound rest in darkness, trauma heals by itself, and joy returns.

It's that simple. For 13 millennia, we have been but weeks away from joy, health, and peace. 

In our trauma-induced psychosis, we came to believe that lack of joy comes from moral failure. Effort became our smug panacea. But products of effort crumble fast. Effort proves a counterfeit. 

By the will, one can do nothing directly to restore joy, only provide proper conditions. The organism does the rest _autonomically_.

We have been right that something is wrong with us. We have been right that we must do something about it. But we have been wrong about which part of ourselves must do it. At long last, this book puts the issue to rest.

When I first retreated in darkness, I just did it to rest. It worked. After 56 hours, I had caught up on all the sleep I had ever lost. For the first time in decades, I felt awake. I was stunned.

Two years later, the same thing happened. In addition, I felt assured. Calmed. _Well_ in my soul. 

This sense of psychic health stayed with me for months. But how, after a lifetime of depression and alienation?

From hygiene, I remembered two principles:

- the self-healing nature of life
- rest as the primary condition of healing

And little failures of memory in middle age were showing me the organic nature of my psyche.

One morning in a dream, these clues fused in a [conception](/conjecture) of _the restful use of darkness in support of the self-healing psyche_.

I began testing this idea in more darkroom retreats. Lethal psychic issues that had tortured me for a lifetime began resolving themselves spontaneously, as predicted. In 14 years and 27 retreats, I have seen no sign of an end to this process---short of full recovery of psychophysical integrity.

My confidence has grown through what I have learned by testing: what happens in darkness and why; how to retreat and what for. Further progress in this approach requires me to share it. It needs more participation, resources, and velocity. 

Hygienic darkroom retreating requires minimal effort and no faith. Darkness is not a void, but a sanctuary. It is not the absence of light, but the presence of the self. It is yours.
