This is a work of hygiene, the science of health. It is the opposite of medicine, the science of curing disease. Therefore, if you want medical advice, you must seek elsewhere. It is not here.

If you read on, and if you take any action described herein, the responsibility for the consequences lies solely with you. The author, publisher, and distributors are only responsible for making this work available. What you do with it and what comes of it is entirely up to you.






This work is not intended as medical advice. The responsibility for the consequences of your taking any action described herein lies with you or, failing that, your doctor, lawyer, accountant, banker, preacher, or teachers, but on no account with the author, publisher, or distributors.

should be sought but probably with the reader. Though in our strange world, that, too, is up to the choice of each individual.


Hygiene is the science of health, of its preservation and conditions. It consists of reasoning upon observations of the naked senses. Therefore, it belongs to everyone equally.

Hygiene has no patents, no proprietary formulas, no markets to corner. It has no arcane knowledge, only logical and cogent ideas. And practices that are simple, quick, cheap, pleasant, and rational, which everyone can understand and engage in. Since its beginnings in 1822,

All of this has led medicine to treat hygiene as a threat and danger to the public. As if medicine were ever the guardian of the public and not its albatross. 

Medicine, being the science of curing disease, is the opposite of hygiene. It is negatively oriented. , which is a mistake. Life does not primarily consist of getting rid of bad things but gaining good ones. Secondly  In hygiene, we categorically reject the concept of cure. We regard it as a delusion. It would be an external influence that causes health. But health does not come from outside, but from within, by the organism's own power and action. Neither darkness nor any other condition of health has the power to cure or heal.

Therefore, I do not merely refrain from intending this as medical advice, I intend it as hygienic advice. I regard medicine as pseudo science, a fantastical religion, a symptom of psychosis in itself. There is no cure for it. But there is a way to heal from it, something fundamentally different. Hygiene provides the conditions even for this.
