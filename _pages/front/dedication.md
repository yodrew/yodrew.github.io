_For late friends,  
Lisa Saavedra and John Rosenberg,  
&nbsp; who burned bright in a benighted lifeway  
and so fell long before their time;_

&nbsp;

_And my brilliant, life-imprisoned cousin,  
Damon "Doctor" Durham,  
&nbsp; on whom the sins of our fathers  
are so heavily visited  
&nbsp; &nbsp; these decades of hard time._
