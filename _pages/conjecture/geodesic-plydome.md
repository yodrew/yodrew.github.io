#### Rough draft of plan

I will build a geodesic sphere to do the darkness retreat in. Having been through several of these types of projects, I believe that building it and its contents will likely take three months and cost ~$2000, including personal expenses.

- description
	- Self-Strutting Geodesic Plydome, designed by Buckminster Fuller, perfected by Steve Miller
	- whole icosahedron
	- 12’ diameter
	- floor of new “flat octet truss” design (prototyped)
	- suspended by ropes from trees or resting on 5-point stand
	- needs very quiet location
- containing:
	- bed of new design: light, folds into sofa or away for storage (conceived, not prototyped)
	- inversion swing (to hang upside down)
	- humanure composting toilet (5 gal bucket in box with ventilation)
	- fold-up shower, fed by hot water delivered by support crew
	- rug
	- water dispenser
	- food cooler (ice-pack cooled) for fruits and greens
	- convection powered ventilation system (conceived not prototyped)
	- shelf of new design for clothing, etc (conceived, not prototyped)
	- retreater ![:\)][3]
