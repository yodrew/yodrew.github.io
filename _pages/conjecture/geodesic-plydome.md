#### Rough draft of plan

I will build a geodesic sphere to do the darkness retreat in. Having been through several of these types of projects, I believe that building it and its contents will likely take three months and cost ~$2000, including personal expenses.

- description
    - Self-Strutting Geodesic Plydome, designed by Buckminster Fuller, perfected by Steve Miller
    - whole icosahedron
    - 12’ diameter
    - floor of new “flat octet truss” design (prototyped)
    - suspended by ropes from trees or resting on 5-point stand
    - needs very quiet location
- containing:
    - bed of new design: light, folds into sofa or away for storage (conceived, not prototyped)
    - inversion swing (to hang upside down)
    - humanure composting toilet (5 gal bucket in box with ventilation)
    - fold-up shower, fed by hot water delivered by support crew
    - rug
    - water dispenser
    - food cooler (ice-pack cooled) for fruits and greens
    - convection powered ventilation system (conceived not prototyped)
    - shelf of new design for clothing, etc (conceived, not prototyped)
    - retreater ![:\)][3]
