### five cranial supernovas

These are the five most important books and authors I have ever read. Each has blown my mind, changed my life, and deeply informed and influenced my methods and thinking since I first read it.

| Book | Author | Published | First Read |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [_Atlas Shrugged_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264ATU4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00264ATU4) | Ayn Rand | 1957 | 1990 |
| [_The Continuum Concept_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201050714?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0201050714) | Jean Liedloff | 1975 | 1990 |
| [_Ishmael_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553375407?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0553375407) | Daniel Quinn | 1992 | 2000 |
| [_In Search of the Miraculous_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156007460?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0156007460) | P D Ouspensky | 1947 | 2005 |
| [_The 80/10/10 Diet_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1893831248?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1893831248) | Douglas Graham | 2006 | 2008 |

### notes

Of Rand, Liedloff, and Quinn, I read and liked nearly everything else. There was nothing I strongly disliked.

Ouspensky's other books don't attract me. But Fritz Peters's books about Gurdjieff are great. 

I have just started to study Graham. I sought his crystalline book on diet for over 20 years. His book also stands for Herbert Shelton's masterful work on hygiene, [*Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene*](/f/hygiene.pdf).

### others

- _Introduction to Human Technology_ by [_William Arthur Evans_](/blog/2009/08/william-arthur-evans/). This gets my honorable mention. It was a highly catalytic book that came at a critical moment in late 2006. It is a rare book, discovered by my friend, Sterling.

- _Confessions of an Economic Hit Man_ by John Perkins concretely sums up for me the diabolical process of this culture. It enabled me to finally wash my hands of trying to remediate it, at least in ordinary ways.

- [_Our Universal Journey_](https://www.ourjourneyhome.earth/market-place#section-1592035487385), by George Kavassilas is a unusual and profoundly satisfying book about ontology, the soul, and the cosmic-scale God Control Matrix we live under. I found the style difficult but the ideas astounding and well worth it. See [George on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV75wDOASk_eAijH1idZyya3AE7RmwbG1).

- [_Total Onslaught_](https://adtv.watch/series/total-onslaught) by Walter Veith is a 50-hour, 36-video series about "The Great Controversy" between Christ and Satan. It presents the Bible coherently. Veith exposes the the light and dark forces in the world throughout history, up to the present. I watched about 15 videos. Compelling.

### youth

A few other books really affected me when I was first reading things on my own, starting at age 15. They prepared me for the books above. They are so close to me, it is hard to assess their monumentality, their greatness. Also, they are so central to my thinking, it is hard to objectify them, to separate them from my perspective as I have done in the above list. They are:

- [_Summerhill_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312141378?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0312141378) -A S Neill. This is about a free school in England and its philosophy. Neill was its wise headmaster. He believed in the rights of children and their original goodness. Which his school, still going today, proves. From my parents' shelf. It influenced the teachers of my first school, Horizons.
- [_Magical Child Matures_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525243291?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0525243291) -Joseph Chilton Pearce. This is about developmental psychology, a radical critique of our society, and an attitude toward a way out. From my dad's second wife.
- [_The Songlines_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140094296?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0140094296) -Bruce Chatwin. A paean to the aboriginal worldview and the virtues of walking. From my mother.
- [_The Natural House_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0818000074?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0818000074) -Frank Lloyd Wright. A coherent vision of shelter and the individual. By the hero of my father, who went to Taliesin, Wright's school, under his widow, Olgivanna.
- [_Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0099427869?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0099427869) -Richard Bach. A fool finds a friend and becomes wise. The book gently exposes conventional assumptions. From my brother's shelf.

### childhood

- [_The Prophet_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394404289?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thedarknessco-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0394404289) -Khalil Gibran. My first book of wisdom, from my mother.
- _The Dark is Rising_ - Susan Cooper. Haunting, quiet imagery. A boy hero seeks out talismans he'll need to face down a world-menacing force.
- _Farmer Boy_ - Laura Ingalls Wilder. Pure American decency and virtue, read to us by my father.
- _James and the Giant Peach, Danny the Champion of the World, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six Others_ - Roald Dahl. Dahl unchains children in his stories and in the visions of his readers. _James_ was read to us at Horizons School. My parents bought me the rest. Of course, everyone saw _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ every year on TV with Gene Wilder from 1971 (avoid the creepy 2005 version). The book and its sequel are good.
