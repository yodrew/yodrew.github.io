### 1992-93

#### Existence

I am full to bursting  
I am a dandelion drooping with dew  
I am my swollen lower lip and quaking eyes,  
lusting for her flesh and loins

I am a cat tensed to pounce  
I am my skin stretched tight and tingling  
over clean sinew and bone  
My muscle strands stream over them  
Like the river over stone

And it comes  
Finally  
To the sea  
I am awash  
I am alone  
I am come to me

#### Axioms

Words I cannot hold  
For the stars shine right through them  
It is the stars that I contemplate tonight

They are steady and quiet  
While meteors and eclipses  
Bustling this way and that  
Fawn for attention

Their presence is subtle and final  
To those who look  
They are indifferent  
To those who see  
They are obliged

Seeker  
Pause  
There is breath beneath your breath  
And words  
Beneath the words which escape you  
Words that should  
In every waking moment  
Hum in your head

In stillness  
One falls  
Touches old bruises  
Exhaustion  
Longing  
And returns to the meanings of those  
Underwords

#### Who Needs It

– to the memory of Ayn Rand

By definition  
I am conscious.  
Correct

It can work  
Only one way  
It: everything there is  
What is it?  
Name it  
The feeling of identification is pleasure  
And nothing can alter that fact

I wanted so much to want  
I could not break any laws  
Then what?  
Which way?  
What had scattered the signs  
From the roads that lead off from here  
Could it mark them again

The thing to pull it all together  
What would it be…  
What would it be?  
By definition  
Philosophy

#### My Father Lives in Twin Falls, Idaho

I am not the kind  
Who can walk down a main street with impunity  
My body is a monolith  
My blood stands still  
The numbness is a forcefield  
Which a draws a dangerous man close to me

I am going to the open desert  
For safety  
To be worn clean  
So that I may never have to walk down a main street again

#### Right Now

The very best thing possible is happening  
I am living

Food falls down my throat  
And my chilled flesh  
-it does not go to the bone anymore-  
Warms in this temporarily benevolent fluorescence

I have just enough time to regain my direction  
And the will to reenter a damp canyon  
Where again  
I'll find the courage to sleep

To walk a mile  
To go from this glow  
To trees and a moonlit creek  
Is to crumple into the hand of a giant  
Who rests a world away

I am ready  
This was worth six bits

#### Disguise

I have collapsed into depravity  
By way of prodigality  
I hoped that you are fooled  
And I hope that you are amused  
By my efforts to nobility

Mine is the disguise of a spy  
Who is about to depart enemy territory  
For the last time  
He is tired  
More and more  
He feels that he did not penetrate it  
But that his own fatherland  
Deeply screwed him

Ergo the appearance of a wastrel  
Yes, I've squandered the money I've earned  
But what I've been given  
I've spent well

Now  
I've laid the plan  
And collected the gear  
I am vacating my place here  
Listen for a whoosh  
Then a crash  
An implosion, I think  
Will be a fitting end  
To this place and this mask

#### Man

No proper adjective  
No possible qualifier  
Common: Contradictory  
Independent: Redundant  
Pluralization: Impossible

Exclusion of the unwilling  
By definition  
His identity  
Free, alone, complete  
A city-state-nation unto himself

This...
[lost lines]
...  

Quiet, he says  
The mob absent  
The comportment of his soul  
Named

#### The Words

Hear now the words  
Which beseech thee to perceive their origins:  
Freedom  
Heaven  
Life

Dumb and still you were  
Till their vibrations  
Cohered inside your head

Flowering language  
Trumpeted from every peak  
Drowns if a child whispers them  
In some lonely glen

The crickets and the wind will cease their own movements  
And conspire to aid him  
Lifting his feet  
And covering their fall amidst enemies  
Who writhe and languish all around

First the air into the lung  
To start the friction for the tongue  
To forge into a rapier drawn  
Thy thoughts! behold thy foe hast gone

No potent threat can be heard  
By the one who seeks and speaks these words

#### May I have this last dance?

I have my secret  
And I am going  
Do you hear?  
I am going, I am going!

At last the boat docks and I depart  
The oars and sails are my spokesmen  
Do you listen?  
They bid you adieu

You needn't hear me say it again  
For I am going  
A thousand, thousand times you've heard it from me  
But now it is true

I am going  
I am going  
I am gone

#### untitled

In the dark  
In the deep  
In the stone  
In the keep

There is I  
With the key  
And the sky  
Envelopes me

The sea's drops  
The Earth's rocks  
The jetty heavens  
Time stops

Breathe in, breathe out  
The seething din and the shout  
Resonate in the settling calm  
The tones, now heard  
now dancing in my palm

#### Planet and World

Never have I considered these things as the same

Here is the planet, Earth  
I can touch it  
And live here  
It sings to me  
And if I break a limb  
I bury it  
And cease eating  
And rise in three weeks  
Whole

There is this world  
—a coalition of polities on a planet—  
In which people live unsecretly  
There, we cannot hide what we are, what we do  
It all comes out  
It is all there  
And look at it

Then there is the world that could be  
Another world  
Separate or greater  
A world of freedom  
That one can found

Tinder gathers on its blueprint  
Some now aim their sparks there  
A breeze collects itself

You will see others smeared with grey  
Some walking  
Some dead  
Before the rains, everything will be grey  
This new world will rise  
From ashes

### 1999 – present

#### Eating Bitter

I see every truth  
And every falsehood  
Resolve to truth

Finally I am fed  
By all this bitterness  
For it was salt that grew it  
Salt and humus  
The blood of so many gone before

Including me  
Yes I was here before  
I wept and died here countless times  
Horses would crush my body  
And kick it into the canal  
Where it would catch  
On branches and barbed wire  
And decompose into beds  
For native flowers that never bloom  
And malva and sheep sorrel and fat hen

That today  
I sit by the water  
In the seat of longing  
And eat  
And eat  
Until the hunger is satisfied

Twin Falls 1999 Jul

#### Not Quite

What happens  
If I tell you  
That ecstasy always plays at my bones  
Catches my breath  
Wipes out history?

What will it be for me-  
Cross or scaffold?  
Do you have any idea  
How much you hate purity?  
How ferociously you cultivate  
the drama of pain and achievement?

But this only provokes  
Your "Work,"  
As if, somehow,  
God left something undone.

#### Grass's benediction

Grass is benediction  
To my feet

I had forgotten  
Shoes clogged my brain

If you're strong  
You can eat it  
Said the tough-footed boy

Across the valley  
Bare-limbed disiduous trees  
The beard of the hills

And the clouds  
Write themselves  
On paper

#### Audience With Myself

If I could meet myself  
At this point in my life  
I would place all my hopes in myself

My secret longing for the sacred  
Would find second wind  
In the clues falling from my lips  
In the excited tension throughout my back  
In my sweet wish to make love  
To marry any one  
Of the beautiful, perfectly loveable women I meet everyday  
Everyone of whom I feel myself falling in love with

I would throw myself at my feet, sobbing,  
Deliver me! Deliver me! You are my only hope!  
I would beg all the saints  
Disguised as the ordinary people  
Who surround this self of my present  
Please help him
To help me,  
To remember me  
Remember all his own failings, which I am  
Remember everything that led me to this point  
Remember everyone like me  
Sobbing at our own feet, Deliver me! Deliver me!

If I could meet myself at this point in my life  
I would place all my hopes in myself  
Seal my love  
For myself, for life, for others, for this lovely Earth,  
Seal it in wax  
Feed it to the flame in the hearts  
Of all our selves  
Whom we might now meet at this point in our lives  
Again and again and again and again

LV 2001 Mar

#### Kamikazes

When love becomes a life and death matter  
Even sweeping the floor is urgent

In washing the dishes  
the universe hangs in the balance  
Swallowing morsels of food  
stuns and dumbfounds even the quick and articulate  
A salad is a vision of god  
And just sitting down is an act of war

Who is the gremlin  
That gives things meaning?

It occupies my heart  
It has locked itself in  
It is making ransom demands  
It intimates that you are in its care  
But for how long?!

These things cannot, however, concern me  
I lean back  
Let the sun hit my neck  
Like so many kamikazes  
Coming in

Seattle 2001 Dec

#### 2002.01.19, for B

Did I storm your yard?  
I bid you relax  
Then caught you off guard  
Now I know the facts

Now your face is too much  
Only your feet can play in my mind  
These I can see and touch  
Without going numb or blind

These rhymes spring from love  
Won't you believe this old heart?  
Fly to me flitting dove  
May we nevermore be apart

You are wine, I, a drunken cup  
The sky opens and you pour down  
At the first red drops I look up  
At the receding blue before I drown

#### The crest and the trough

Waiting for an opening  
And then  
Into the breach

Endless controls  
Waffling toward zero

I touch a place now  
where I cannot  
Move against my feeling  
Anymore

#### Corduroy Classic 2001

– for Micha Grainger

Youth, man: that's IT  
Said Micha

Micha chases a lost rabbit  
The furbearer of his people  
Multiplying  
Soft  
Despised  
Elusive

See his comical corduroy cap  
His flaring pants  
The missing white member  
Of Fat Albert's gang  
Showing up late  
The party's second wind

Look!  
Old-school court shoes  
Improbably shined and flashing  
Twisting on the carpet  
Hands waving like daisies  
Laughter springing up goofy  
and hip:  
For the people  
For his people

Others chase their own dreams  
Micha chases the dream of his people  
Assured and fleet  
On his lucky furry feet

#### Breathe

There is no agency  
—let alone free agency—  
Only one long chain of life  
Binding us all to its winding course

Belong to it!  
Your strains against it  
Only pull it tighter against the rest of us  
Against we  
Who will bear it smiling  
Be assured

For what choice have we?  
Strain, do not strain:  
We belong  
It has us  
Has us

#### The Battle of Wounded Knee

– for Rob Bolman

The traveler of pregnant faith  
Sets foot on the distant path  
God is with him  
God is with him

Sing god's name with his  
God is everything  
And he is only dust  
Yet sing their names together

Many hopes follow on his heels  
Like friendly cats  
Longing pours from his eyes  
Unbearable tension rips his limbs from his body  
But he pulls himself forward by his chin and forehead,  
his abdomen and pelvis

God is with him  
God awaits him  
With prostheses that work better  
Than the arms and legs  
Of a born champion

This one will be made

Among the six billion cells of Maitreya's body  
This one finds his way home twice:  
in leaving and in returning

Godspeed, traveler,  
Closing his door and already far away,  
Godspeed.

Eugene 2006 Jan
