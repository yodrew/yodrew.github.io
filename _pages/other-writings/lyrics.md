[Send me $20](/back/services#pay) for a copy of my record, "Resolve", recorded in 1995.

### Exactly Me

Exactly me  
Exactly me

The chains go round and round  
I fill the space with my empty head  
Stumbling and sliding through the night  
Lying painful in my bed

Exactly this moment  
And I'm turning side by fire  
And when I'm alone  
Oh no, again I'm alone  
Where this journey ends  
The sad-filled time expires

Exactly me  
Exactly me

No I see through this dance  
I insist its a trance  
And the moons they plod in their orbits  
The vampires coo  
No, nothing's new  
Still the morning falls all the harder

Chorus

This is nowhere to be  
When I don't know where to go  
I want so much to say yes  
But I wake up shouting no  
Dig in or retreat  
Forfeit or cast away  
Or quiet, hold your head  
There is a way

Chorus

### A Candle for the Sun

I lost a candle to the rising sun  
Found myself doing things I'd never done  
I left my life as I knew it to rot  
I was selling things of mine I hadn't bought

This story begins in yesteryear  
A child sits in a corner of fear  
He has one match and a candle to  
To come up even he knows what he's got to do

He strikes the match and the room is lit  
His eyes adjust, take in bit by bit  
He moves the match closer to the candle  
And when the wick fires, that's his life's preambleee

Chorus

He pokes around, asks, What's this place about?  
Without a word, the bones reply, You should get out  
This room's a hole in the bottom of a pit  
But your flame is bright, just keep it lit

He cuts his knee and he wipes his brow  
He seeks the truth, he's climbing up and out  
The wick grows short, it burns his hand  
So what: hear the crack of dawn, feel the gust, it's open land

Chorus

### Overcome

While my body stays in  
And my soul flies out  
I wonder why I'm singing  
When I barely know what I'm about

Brother said, Be cool, go slow, just hang  
Maybe I'll feel a change  
I trip, I fall, I feel wholly dumb  
Still, I keep my pretensions to overcome

It's the method, not the madness  
Though the words be transcendent  
Complicated by my false humility  
Juxtaposed with an arrogant tranquility

Chorus

Beaten and cornered, the boy will fight  
Then to survive is to know he's right  
If a door open up, he'll take his flight  
The wings of his mind free him from his might

Chorus

### The Truth Is Mine to Know

Thank you  
But, no thank you

Oh, heal me, fire in the night  
Close these wounds and banish my fright  
Lead my from the darkness to light I've barely known  
Take this feeble heart and tell me what you've shown

I've given up my upbringing  
And all the lies therein  
I've broken through it singing  
I see my soul robed in the colors of heaven

Tearing through the falsehood  
Bearing all the truth it could  
It's here  
They say the truth is relative  
But the rock ain't relative

Thank you,  
But no, thank you

I'm alive  
I remember

### I recognize I

If these tears are not mine  
Then my path you could define  
But I hear this wail as my own  
And so I cannot fetch your bones

I recognize I  
Until the day I die  
On that day I can no longer see  
I trust you to bury me

There is a picture of you and Father  
King-like he holds you as your eyes stream water  
Perhaps you were tripped as you chased your ball  
And his scepter could not break your fall

Now that we've sailed from his realm  
I think you've seen that one must man his own helm

What do you want of me, won't you just say?  
The sounding of brass must needs drive me away  
Act as my consience, you'll play to a shell  
This water's poison, find a new well

Chorus

### Will

I don't got it  
But I want it  
I don't know what it is  
I just know that it's there

I will search it out  
And forsake my doubt  
I defy the mob  
And its doctrine of despair

Chorus:  
I am your child  
But I am still doing this  
Picking up what was your burden  
Gonna find my way to bliss

If you find this song a mystery  
You probably grew up with hope and history  
Hope that someday things will get better  
History of the fact that they never did

You question my anger  
You are amused  
It kind of makes me wonder  
Are your children confused  
About their desires  
And why they are here  
Cause that is just what happens  
When you're born in love and raised in fear

Chorus

I'm staking my life  
On a very dangerous thing  
On a 40 year old man  
Who knows about what I sing

Who'll give me the rites of passage  
And show me the work of his hands  
He'll call forth my spirit  
And I'll come forth a man

Chorus  
First verse

### Descend

Gospel mission  
City street  
Ancient forest  
Public beach  
There I walked and I slept  
There I worked and I wept

Things fall apart

My sadness  
Sweet with age  
Staled to numbness  
Rotted to rage  
Rage melted to silence  
And silence became my cage

I'm not angry  
I am sad  
From myself it well  
But hiding has broken my back  
I've been shoveling coal in hell

Something bellows in my brain  
Like commandment from god:  
You were injured  
Unearth the pain  
It's buried under the sod

Things fall apart

Though I want you  
I beware you  
I will frustrate you ways of harm  
I am hurt some day I will trust you  
To hold me in your arms

### Farewell

I don't care about getting ahead  
I just want to break even  
Yes you heard me right  
When I said  
After I've paid my debt, I'm leaving  
For good  
Did you ever think I would

So this is my leaving song  
I wish to say farewell  
I'll throw down all my possessions  
By a healing water well  
Watch the face in the shadowy water  
Hear it sing my namee  
Here the sound the I grew deaf to  
While playing this game

To the north woods or the deserts in the south  
Wherever I'm allowed to survive  
If to Earth, I'm a burden  
Let me drown in the river's mouth  
Better dead in harmony  
Than discordant and alive

And I'll be wild as a doe  
And watch the flowers grow  
Feel a desert heat wave roll  
Scorching some truth from my soul

I think they planned for my embittered wrath  
Strategically numbing me and diverting me from my path  
So I'm on my way, I'm getting off the beaten path  
Open up to the signs and find my way back

Chorus

### Odyssey

Odysseys  
And time fell on a snowflake

I'm nearly done with farming  
Can you see the pines  
Waving you goodbye  
Citylife?

I am green  
With the sounds my bare feet make  
On the spongy leaves-will-be-humus

I twist at my ankles  
Bugs of joy  
Crawl in anticipation  
Up my tibia and fibia

Odysseys  
And time fell on a snowflake

More pine boughs  
Usher me to sleep  
At the tree's base

At the base of a tree  
In my Odyssey…

### Minstrel's lullaby

Far away, far away  
I must go far away  
There is water whence I go  
Far away

O'er the hill, o'er the hill  
I will climb up o'er the hill  
I will quench my thirst  
I will drink my fill  
O'er the hill

But while I'm here  
Reason makes the rhyme  
The heart keeps the time  
The rooster tells us when to fall asleep

It's so simple it's so easy  
You can sit all night and grin  
And when the child knocks, you let him in

### untitled love song

She is ready, she is Tona  
She says, I like you, I wanna…  
You know what I mean

Yes, I know what you mean all too well  
That's the garden where I was forbidden to dwell  
But if you hold the gate awhile  
I'll be along to share your smile  
And I'll bring you a rose  
A cutting for the garden

The sun sets, and you tire  
The wind through the leaves  
Like fingers on a lyre  
But tarry longer  
Let the gold fire wane  
I'm walking straight down the lane  
To bring you a rose  
A cutting for the garden

I come at dark, you look down  
You point the way  
I plant the branch in the ground  
There I sleep  
While you go off to bed  
In the morning  
You'll see the rose is red

And you'll bar the gate  
The entrance to the garden  
Where I want to live  
The rest of my life

### Roots

Where are my roots?

I take off my shoes I take off my socks  
To find with my feet what we what I have lost  
I splash in the mud I roll in the dirt  
I run on the land that for roots must come first

Yeah, Mother  
Yeah, Father  
You gave shelter, clothes and food  
But you missed something  
Where are my roots?

I'm floating up my head's a hot air balloon  
Can't feel the ground if I don't have any roots  
I was driving through the midwest  
Behind a rest stop I ran  
I dove my fingers into the dirt  
Into the Earth  
Into the soil  
Into the land

Chorus

Walking weary by the edge of the road  
Thumbing for a ride  
Now roots for a displaced people  
Roots for them, they grow inside

Chorus
