### flaw

Hygiene's primary structure is sound. It deals in universal facts of biology. It is objective. It constrains its analysis and recommendations to the abilities of a reasonable man living an ordinary life nearly anywhere in the world. 

But hygiene has secondary flaws. It has lacked a psychology. Its general pathology avoids trauma, the first cause of disease. We must correct these. 

Hygiene has not been hygienic enough. Some of its secondary ideas and practices contradict its fundamental principles. So we can use hygiene's own principles and methods to correct it. This self-correcting quality is a hallmark of great systems.

Darkness exposes flaws in hygiene's secondary structure. Hygiene can accommodate darkness and its implications. In this chapter, we will pop the hood of hygiene and get our hands dirty. We will analyze its flaws and make necessary modifications. The result will be a system that works better by orders of magnitude.

#### reform

Lacking a psychology, hygiene could not penetrate the depths of human experience. It could not deal with the grave issue of trauma. Hygiene has focused on daily choices. Trauma doesn't happen every day. It lies beyond one's control. Changes of habit affect it little. Trauma strikes, incapacitating whole systems. It distorts their character and behavior beyond recognition.

Besides rest, trauma is the most influential force in our lives. Lacking the greatest means of profound rest, hygiene was helpless with trauma. It deferred to doctors (and priests). This subordinated hygiene to medicine and religion for nearly two centuries.

Hygiene's helplessness disappears with four reforms: 

- organization and completion of its laws
- locating trauma at the root of illness 
- recognizing darkness as the essential means nature provides us to heal from trauma
- including a psychology based on these facts

With these, hygienism becomes a complete system of health. It is capable of addressing every illness people face, physical and psychical. No one need suffer further the absurdities of medicine and other pseudo-scientific systems. To various degrees, they are all rooted in the mystical doctrine of original sin and practice of exorcism.

The acid test of any science is its ability to predict events and thus cause or prevent them if desired. By healing from trauma, we not only end dysfunction and suffering, we prevent retraumatization. I mean we cease unconsciously arranging of like car crashes, familial breakdown, and psychosomatic illness and its medical treatment.

By contrast, medicine can only deal with trauma after the fact. Its tricks for treating it impress us. We respect doctors' willingness to try. But if medicine were science, it could explain, predict, and prevent further trauma. The attention it puts on treatment diverts attention from its inherent incompetence. Crippled by false premises, it cannot understand or reverse the cause of trauma.

We are all moments from relief, days from restedness and healing, and months from total recovery from 13 millennia of abysmal suffering, problems, and failure. The cause of joy---an organism restored to wholeness---is at hand.

Safe in the submarine of this insight, we will plumb the depths of the hygienic use of darkness. We will begin by reviewing and critiquing hygiene's existing framework for understanding illness: its incisive **pathology**. Then we will go beyond it in frank discussions of **trauma**, **psychosis** and their natural and social causes in **cataclysm**. We will finish with an outline of a new and **hygienic psychology**, which promises to unleash hygiene's power and lift mankind from its debilitated state.

### pathology

Pathology is the study of disease: its nature, causes, and symptoms. Pathology guides our response to disease.

Every school of health has a pathology, a theory of disease. Many schools are named for them. They are primarily orientated to disease and their artful responses to it. Examples are homeopathy (_homeo_: same), naturopathy (_natur_: of nature), osteopathy (_osteo_: bone), allopathy/medicine (_allo_: other).

By contrast, hygiene is primarily concerned with the cause and conditions of health. Hygiene's pathology is merely a branch called orthopathy (_ortho_: correct).

My formulation of hygiene's generic pathology is simple. It describes the three ways an organism falls ill: by trauma, exhaustion, or poisoning. It describes the three corresponding ways it heals: repair, elimination, and re-energization.

1. **causes of disease**
	1. **trauma**: injury or damage to living tissue, whether psychical or psychical, subtle or gross. The younger the individual is, the greater his susceptibility to trauma, the subtler its form, and the wider its variety (eg, not sleeping with parents or not being nursed); yet the more rapid his recovery can be. If unhealed, trauma leads to exhaustion and poisoning, thus every illness over time.
	2. **exhaustion**: a greatly lowered energy state, sudden or prolonged. It results from overwork, distress, intense emotion, or extreme environmental factors: danger, temperature, atmospheric pressure, noise, frequencies, vibration, etc (equivalent to _enervation_, below).
	3. **poisoning**: intake of a toxic substance, emotion, impression, or idea (similar to _toxemia_, below). The organism expends tremendous energy in neutralizing and expelling it. Chronic or exceeding intake leads to every known disease.
2. **processes of healing**
	1. **repair**: the renewal and replacement of tissue after normal use; the regeneration and knitting of tissue back together following trauma
	2. **elimination**: removal of waste and toxins, both endogenous and exogenous, from cells through the lymph, blood, and organs of elimination
	3. **re-energization**: recharging of exhausted nerves and refueling of cells

The above hygienic pathology is new. It is my simplification and radicalization of the old one. The old pathology helps explain disease once it has begun. But it does not satisfactorily explain the inception of disease, nor the corresponding means of its reversal. We will review and critique the old pathology now.

#### old

In the 1930s, hygienist, Dr John Tilden formulated the seven stages of all chronic disease. He based this on a century of hygienic observation of vital energy in the organism. Each stage describes what happens as vital energy declines and poisoning (toxemia) increases. Note that a sick person can move down the steps and become sicker, or up them and become well. It is cause and effect. 

Hygiene proves in theory and repeatedly demonstrates in practice the reversibility of the trend. This pathology has aided millions of people in understanding and reversing the sicknesses that medicine gave up on helping them with. 

[Victoria Bidwell](https://getwellstaywellamerica.com) is a longtime, tireless hygienist. We have her to thank for this cogent [summary](https://bit.ly/pathsummary). It is from her work, _The Health Seekers Yearbook_. It is based on Dr Tilden's analysis of disease from his book, _Toxemia_.

1. **Enervation**: Nerve energy is so reduced or exhausted that all normal bodily functions are greatly impaired, especially the elimination of endogenous and exogenous poisons. Stage one thus begins the progressive and chronic process of "toxemia toleration" that continues through all of the following stages. The toxic sufferer does not feel his "normal self." He feels either stimulated or depressed by the poisonous overload.
2. **Toxemia**: Nerve energy is too low to eliminate metabolic wastes and ingested poisons. These toxic substances begin to saturate first the bloodstream and lymphatic fluids and then the cells themselves. The toxic sufferer feels inordinately tired, run-down, and "out of it."
3. **Irritation**: Toxic build-up within the blood and lymph and tissues continues. The cells/tissues where build-up occurs are irritated by the toxic nature of the waste, resulting in a low-grade inflammation. The toxic sufferer can feel exhausted, queasy, irritable, itchy, even irrational and hostile. During these first 3 stages, if the toxic sufferer does consult a medical doctor about the reason for his low energy and irritability, the doctor tells him: "There is nothing wrong with you. These symptoms are ‘all in your head.’ You are perfectly healthy!"
4. **Inflammation**: The low-grade, chronic inflammation from stage three is leading to the death of cells. An area or organ where toxicants have amassed next becomes fully inflamed. The toxic sufferer experiences actual pain, along with pathological symptoms at this point. With the appearance of these symptoms, the medical doctor can finally give the sufferer’s complaint a name. Traditionally, medical scientists have named many of the 20,000 distinctly different diseases after the site where the toxins have accumulated and precipitated their symptoms. Once the set of symptoms is conveniently named, the doctor can mechanically prescribe the "antidote" from his Physician’s Desk Reference or from his memorized medical/ pharmaceutical repertoire. Standard medical doctors thus commence drugging and treating at this stage.
5. **Ulceration**: Tissues are destroyed. The body ulcerates, forming an outlet for the poisonous build-up. The toxic sufferer experiences a multiplication and worsening of symptoms while the pain intensifies. Standard medical doctors typically continue drugging and often commence with surgery and other forms of more radical and questionable treatment at this stage.
6. **Induration**: Induration is the result of long-standing, chronic inflammation with bouts of acute inflammation interspersed. The chronic inflammation causes an impairment or sluggishness of circulation: and because some cells succumb, they are replaced with scar tissue. This is the way we lose good, normal-functioning cells — by chronic inflammation and death of cells. Toxins may or may not be encapsulated in a tumor, sac, wen, or polyp. The toxic sufferer endures even more physical pain, which is intensified by the emotional distress of realizing that he is only getting worse, regardless of his earnest, obedient, even heroic attempts to get well. Standard medical doctors continue with both drugging and surgery and all other kinds of modalities deemed appropriate, both conventional and experimental. ("Induration" means "hardening" or "scarring" of tissues.)
7. **Fungation** (cancer): Cellular integrity is destroyed through their disorganization and/or cancerous proliferation. Tissues, organs, and whole systems lose their ability to function normally. Biochemical and morphological changes from the depositing of endogenous and exogenous toxins bring about degeneration and death at the cellular level. The toxic sufferer is "a pathological mess": he is on his deathbed. Standard medical doctors declare at this stage: "There is no hope left. You have just so much longer to live. You need to make preparations accordingly." Failure of vital organs eventually results in death.

#### revision

Tilden's analysis shows the close relationship between exhaustion and poisoning as two of the most obvious causes of all illness. Indeed, they play a huge part in ongoing symptomology. It shows where a sick person really is in the course of illness. It subtly informs one's response. It explains hygiene's countless unpublicized successes for two centuries with people allopathy had pronounced hopeless. 

Usually, hygienists put people to bed with plenty of water and fresh air and cease to poison them with drugs. If clients can improve their lifestyles enough afterward, then they will not relapse. Common advice is to quit the ultra-toxins of coffee, tea, and tobacco; eliminate overwork and reduce stress; increase daily rest; increase fresh food in the diet; take up exercise; fast sometimes; and move away from polluted areas.

But for many of us, that is a big **if**. If we could do it, we wouldn't have our problems in the first place. If we do not do it, then hygiene has been unable to help us further. Most of us drift back to medicine. A few get lucky with alternatives in reducing their worst symptoms. The rest find ways to cope… or perish quietly.

We note the pathology's emphasis on toxemia: chronic internal uncleanliness. This reveals not only Tilden's focus but Natural Hygiene's Puritanical character. It is how medicine trapped hygienism by reducing it to cleanliness. It is why the word, hygiene, makes everyone think of cleanliness despite what the dictionary says.

**The missing link in orthopathy is trauma**. Its absence has undermined hygiene's success and status. Early hygienists viewed chronic illness as important. They did not grasp the primacy of trauma: its causal relation to chronic illness. They saw trauma as a mechanical issue best left to surgeons. 

For their part, the surgeons relished the challenge. Their willingness to deal with trauma is the source of medicine's dominance today. By surrendering the imperative of trauma, hygienists lent allopathy mythic power.

Most early hygienic physicians started as allopaths. It seems they never shook their fascination with surgery. Surgery makes doctors seem powerful on nature's scale. It affirms civilization's fear of the body and nature. It reinforces the feeling of helplessness following trauma.

Engaging the dragon of trauma with their little swords, doctors acquire the status of gods and heroes. On some level, everyone knows trauma is the cause of all suffering, disease, and incapacity. Everyone recognizes it the moment it is stated, either by a bowed head, widened eyes, or nodding—or haughty denial (which I've seen a thousand times.) Unhealed trauma has destroyed most of our precious personal power. Anyone who can bring back even a little of it must be divine. Trauma makes for great drama.

Fortunately, rationality prevails in hygiene. It is, after all, a science. Both etymology and biology help us correct hygiene's over-emphasis on cleanliness. In the three phases of healing, repair is fundamental to elimination. The organism cleans itself only as it repairs itself. Repair causes a mess. It must be cleaned up as it proceeds. Damaged tissue is unprotected and dysfunctional. It collects debris. The body awaits a chance to repair itself. Meanwhile, it conserves energy by only cleaning what it must.

This explains endless detoxification when switching to a clean diet. Improved diet cannot fix trauma. At best, it exposes it.

Likewise, the organism re-energizes tissue only as it repairs and cleans itself. Tissue is fully charged only when its integrity is completely restored. Therefore, trauma comes before exhaustion and poisoning in the pathology. Remaining stages become subordinate to these primary three. Thus the revised pathology.

Disease can begin with any of these three. But chronic disease originates in unhealed trauma. In healthy organisms, self-correcting instincts are strong. They immediately prompt an individual to restore normal conditions if exhaustion and poisoning occur in daily life. Only trauma can wreck these instincts or make acting on them impossible. Exhaustion and poisoning follow on its heels.

We seem caught in a strange dream, half-waking and prolonged. We have tried to force ourselves awake with treatment, substances, and discipline. Hygienic darkroom retreating lets us sleep it off. Hygiene is like physiological judo. It does not resist disease, but lets disease bring its own resolution. 

Hygiene is calm, understanding, effective. Rather than wait for trauma to replay its disastrous drama in our lives, we can finally prevent it by healing from it. We simply take hygiene's peaceful, reassured approach to resolving it once and for all.

#### allopathy

As Hygieia is the daughter of Aesculapius, the Greek god of medicine, so is hygiene partly a reaction to allopathy, which we are so exposed to. So next we will examine medical pathology.

Critics of medicine first called it allopathy. Medicine uses poisons to cause symptoms of _another_ disease. The idea is that, in the body's forced struggle against the other disease, it will overcome the first one. Then the poisonous medicine is removed. The patient quickly recovers from the artificial disease and is left in health. 

When sick, take poison. Hurt yourself to be well. 

War is peace. Love is hate. Freedom is slavery.

The doctrine of original sin underlies allopathy. This doctrine says life is inherently corrupt and impotent. Suffering and disease are natural and unavoidable. They are our fate. We are not naturally well. We must be forced to be well, just as we must be forced to be good. Nevermind that:

- life is self-healing
- intact organisms are healthy
- survival requires health (we would not have made this far without it)
- health is the identity of life
- the rest of living nature exhibits near-universal health

Allopathy sidesteps these facts with civilization's mystical axiom of human exceptionalism. That is, natural laws do not apply to us. We are inherently sinful and sick because we are men.

Allopathy pretends to be rational and scientific. Yet it views health as a stroke of luck. "You must have a good constitution," they say before changing the subject. When people get sick, there's nothing wrong. It's just how life is. Medicine itself is not an abject failure. 

This is why doctors gloss over causes. They speak in tautologies, substituting diagnosis for explanation. For example, "Your bowels aren't working because you have Crohn's disease." It's as if the name is a irreducible primary.

It leaves nothing to investigate. Life is just expressing its weak, morbid nature. Doctors might peer into an illness's causation another level or two to explain it. But this goes against their premises. They usually skip right to symptomology and treatment---syringe, scalpel, and the germ theory of disease in hand.

The germ theory says microscopic invaders cause disease. We are victims of infection. The organism is helpless, the doctor is capable. He must fight, overcome, and root out the germs with drugs, treatment, and surgery. Medicine is really a modern, pseudo-scientific recasting of Dark Ages demonism. A doctor is a materialist exorcist.

Trouble is, the presence of germs doesn't always result in the disease associated with them. They aren't always present in it. Getting rid of them doesn't always get rid of the disease. And getting over the disease doesn't always get rid of the germs that supposedly caused it. (See [Koch's Postulates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch%27s_postulates)). So much for the germ theory. 

In terms of vital factors, history, and lifestyle, distinct patterns repeat among those who suffer. A different set of patterns obtains among those who do not suffer. The differences reveal the ordinary and predictable character of the causes of disease—to those who look. 

In response, medicine continually moves the goalposts. It invents new diagnoses to cover for the insanity of its pathology. It is a holy war, exempt from logic. Its casualties keep its secrets.

Fortunately, some people tire of medicine in time. They just want to be well so they can get on with their lives. They quit the doctors, strike out on their own, and hope for the best. Medicine is so harmful, this proves remarkably successful[^1].

A hygienist's rational and benevolent view of disease keeps him cool as a cucumber. He does not react to symptoms out of context. He immediately provides good conditions. He observes. He studies. He adjusts the conditions as necessary.

Disease is a normal function of an organism under poor conditions. It is not an enemy but a messenger. One does not fight against it, but listens. It is not a foreign entity to attack and expel. Hygiene makes the time necessary to correct allopathy's drunken imbalances by using careful etiology (the study of causes).

This approach reveals the poor conditions behind diseases and ordinary ways to correct them. Indeed, a client of a hygienist is really a student. He soon learns to take care of himself, then his family and neighbors. It's open source health care. Viral, so to speak.

For further study of hygienic pathology, see Herbert Shelton's two volumes on orthopathy. One is on [general pathology](https://soilandhealth.org/book/the-hygienic-system-vol-vi-orthopathy/), one is on specific [symptoms and responses](https://health4thebillions.org/product.php?id_product=91). Now we will more closely examine the primary cause of disease, trauma. 

### trauma

In the course of days alone in a darkroom, psychic trouble from one's past inevitably comes to the surface. Buried thoughts, feelings, sensations, and memories of trauma sometimes become conscious as the psyche repairs itself. This is not the torment of endlessly reliving the past, but part of final recovery from it.

Why are these things so deeply buried? 

Besides injury and shock, trauma immediately causes the first four stages of disease that Tilden describes: enervation, toxemia, irritation, inflammation. The organism surges into action with the shock and sudden demand for energy, nutrients, circulation, and hormones to manage pain and awareness. Meanwhile, incapacity and malfunction snowball.

Consciousness contracts with trauma. The psyche contracts from the world on a sensory level. It restricts higher functions like reflection and reason, diverting their energy rations to stabilize critical functions. Awareness of the painful event itself is unnecessary. It often disturbs the process. This is why trauma manifests as amnesia, denial, stupidity, callousness, and clumsiness: the inabilities to remember, to admit, to know, to feel, to move.

Consider movies with an amnesiac premise. The protagonist is injured, cannot remember his old life, and has a new adventure. Few of us have known anyone like this. Yet such movies continue to draw crowds. We unconsciously recognize ourselves in them. 

Our amnesia begins with what is called infant or childhood amnesia. Who remembers his birth or first years? Who would want to? "Scientists" generally believe that memory does not reach back that far. But indigenous people and less traumatized civilized people demonstrate something else. They casually recount details of leaving the womb, meeting their parents outside, and encountering the world around them for the first time.

By the same token, denial is not moral failure. It is unconscious biological success. Devastating trauma usually befalls civilized infants. Damage, deprivation, and pain overload the fragile structure of their psyches. Denial locks basic functions into routines and restricts higher, creative ones. This prevents trauma from shattering psychic integrity. It also turns people into robots.

If trauma is too great, it overwhelms the psyche's defense mechanisms. The psychic system fails and death results, as with SIDS---Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Or one escapes with autism or blindness, for example. It beats dying. Denial persists until the psyche heals enough to bear witness to the horror of what was denied. 

Meanwhile, we suffer from three other epidemics: stupidity, callousness, clumsiness. Psychic damage causes decreases in thinking, feeling, and moving intelligence. The normal joy, brightness, and grace of most children give way before they have a chance to establish themselves. We look aghast at the pitiful results, in ourselves and in others.

In darkness, damage begins to heal. Denial begins to lift. Traumatic events are remembered or acknowledged. As the capacity for feeling is restored, frozen feelings resurface. Insight comes. Stupidity and uncoordination lift. The energy to recover strength flows back in. The organism paces this sometimes intense process with great care. It never goes too fast or does too much. The fact that it is happening means one has the capacity to handle it. 

Gaining confidence in this capacity takes time. In the section, 
[discomfort](/protocol#discomfort), I describe some ways I learned to moderate intense memory and feeling in darkness in the meantime. Soon, one gets the hang of it and lets go. The autonomic self rushes in to catch one's fall. In a series of [reports](/report), I have recorded my experiences in darkness of beginning to heal from major trauma.

What trauma? I mean the routine brutality of our lifeway. It touches virtually everyone from before birth. I mean not just the bad things we condemn, but common atrocities we mistakenly accept. I mean our many offenses to nature. It already worked out every detail of a happy existence from the beginning of time. In our pathological lifeway, we transgress them continually.

I'm going to list common examples of the plague of polite violence I refer to. One of my editors, a wise and loving man, has warned me I will lose readers by doing so. I see no way around it. The crimes must be named.

- unintentional conception and ambivalent pregnancy
- birth intruders (doctor, midwife, priest, etc)
- post-partum attachment failure (through physical separation, exhaustion, and emotional unavailability)
- vaccination, circumcision
- formula-milk, pacifiers, illegal public nursing
- being unheld, unslept with, unnursed, and diapered
- absent, pushover, smothering, abusive, and negligent parents
- nannies and day care
- cribs, playpens, strollers (the worst designs of all time, which crystallize alienation in the nervous systems of billions.)
- television, computers, games (screen technology causes not mere atrophy, but lifelong damage to the imaginative faculty when much used at critical phases of development.[^2])
- factory food (including unripe harvesting, chemical farming, genetic modification, irradiation) 
- insincerity, negative emotion, and irrational ideas from others
- and finally, the last nail so big it splinters the coffin: _school_. 

The violence of job, military, hospital, the street, and prison go without saying. These things are even worse when they happen to infants, who have a millionth the capacity to endure them.

Of exactly what brutalized _you_, you may already have some idea. I invite you to find out for sure in darkness. There you have a real chance to recover from it once and for all. Between retreats, the depth psychologists mentioned below can also help provide words for what you are going through.

Let's finally get it through our numb skulls: no adult can get brutalized day in and day out for years without being affected. How much worse is it for an infant? We are not indestructible. We are vulnerable to injury. This is not a flaw. It is the conditional nature of organic existence that defines life and makes our spectacular adaptability and joy possible. 

Personal failure originates in psychophysical malfunction from deep damage. We cover up this unpleasant fact by moralizing about weakness, cowardice, inability. Or we shrug it off mystically as bad luck. Chronic failure is not our fault but the result of disaster. We are not weak or bad. We are hurt. We don't need to work harder. We need time to rest so we can heal. We need to recover the capacity to succeed. I suggest we take a mass leave of absence from our absurd existence and find comfortable places to collapse. We'll do it in shifts.

Damage from major psychic trauma is real. It is deep. It persists through generations until it heals.[^3] Meanwhile, it disrupts everything else in our lives: memory, reliability, conscientiousness, poise, digestion, sleep, circulation, coordination, humor, desire, clarity, etc. Everything. The mounting disaster motivates us to take it seriously. We can heal from it. We just need basic, decent conditions in which to do so.

Lastly, unconscious psychic trauma often expresses itself somatically: as physical illness. If you are physically ill, you will certainly find psychic wounds underneath your condition, wounds of surprising intensity. These wounds are doors. On the other side of them lie unexpected paths back to physical health and personal power, the power to live.

Until now, hygienists have regarded the primary causes of disease as enervation, an excessive lowering of vitality; and toxemia, a general poisoning, mostly from internal waste but also food and environmental poisons. These, hygienists have asserted, come from poor habits.

But whence came poor habits? A healthy animal has strong self-correcting instincts. How could it persist in unhealthy behavior out of the blue? It makes no sense. Something must have happened to knock it far off course. Causation by poor habit fails in theory and practice. The awesome influence of trauma explains everything and reveals the solution.

Most of this is standard psychology. Freud himself said all our suffering comes from trauma. Ironically, he said it is necessary for civilization, which keeps us from savagery. Another psychoanalyst, Immanuel Velikovsky, drew the opposite conclusion. Trauma comes from ancient cataclysm. We must heal from it to avoid repeating it unconsciously with nuclear war. 

Wilhelm Reich, Jean Liedloff, Frederick Leboyer, Arthur Janov, Alice Miller, Alexander Lowen, Joseph Chilton Pearce also took heroic stands for mankind in describing the routine brutality of civilized life. And they found various ways to deal with the worst of it. Only, they did not imagine the psyche could repair itself without therapy or discipline. 

Suffice it to say I'm no scientific materialist. That quaint philosophy holds that: 

- a bludgeoned sensorium aided by computers is our only means of knowledge
- man is so special that nature has exempted him from its laws
- technology and anything else generated by civilization itself are inherently good until proven otherwise.

Examples of the absurdity of this idea abound in history. Find excellent elaborations of its humor in _Ishmael_ by Daniel Quinn, _Running on Emptiness_ by John Zerzan, and Rupert Sheldrake's critique of scientism.

The human organism is resilient in some ways and delicate in others. Darkness allows our autonomic selves to put both these qualities to use fully. In blackness, in jetty refuge, in the soft keep of bedroom or cabin, we will right unfathomable wrongs.

### psychosis

Trauma is not just a memory. It is damage with tangible, ongoing consequences. As you would expect, psychic trauma causes psychic illness: psychosis.

Every day, we call things crazy. Under our breath or aloud, we get exasperated with people and situations. What if our colloquialism were clinically accurate? What if it were precisely what is wrong with us? What if we have been right about it the whole time?

Sages throughout history have observed in us civilized people a pattern of _functional mass psychosis_. Functional means able to survive long enough to reproduce. Mass means universal. Psychosis means psychic illness. It has two senses.

Broadly, psychosis means psychic illness. It originates in trauma. Which leads to exhaustion and intoxification. These lead to the abject acceptance of poisonous ideas, attitudes, emotions, and behavior. These compound in further dysfunctions of thinking, feeling, and moving intelligences. Dysfunction leads to failure and pain, both physical, emotional, and intellectual. Sickness, unhappiness, and confusion (including dogmatism) characterize civilized people. Comprehensive chronic dysfunction marks our psychosis.

Narrowly, psychosis means the inability to distinguish fantasy from reality. Our particular fantasy is that the sliver of reality we do know about makes up the whole of reality. Any idea that doesn't fit into our postage stamp-sized worldview gets unnoticed, ignored, or crushed. We can't help it. It is the inevitable pathology of mass major psychic trauma. 

The sliver we know about consists of the grossest part of reality. Scientists call it spacetime: three maneuverable dimensions of space, with one dimension of time, the present, locked in forward motion. Being grossly sensible, spacetime is especially amenable to intellection and mechanical manipulation. 

This gives rise to our hyper-mental, industrial lifeway. We emphasize thinking at the expense of feeling and, to a lesser extent, action. We exalt the useless activity of athletics and prefer to make machines do the rest for us. Obsessive control of this sliver enables enough of us to survive each generation to imagine we are doing as well as possible.

However, some of us find this common state to be... sheer insanity, if you don't mind. We have experienced grace, joy, and flashes of harmony with reality. We cannot help but see glaring proofs of mass psychosis in:

- righteous wars against the innocent
- controls in the name of freedom
- degrading poverty amidst mind-boggling wealth
- useless work and wearisome recreation
- undernourishment from overfeeding
- confusing philosophy and soulless religion
- alienation among crowds---civilization's calling card
- mass depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, slow or fast suicide
- lifestyle diseases (cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and digestive diseases)
- stupefying education
- sickening health care

I could go on. No doubt, you could extend the list yourself. Perhaps you have wept over the world's desperate madness. Perhaps you have wept over your own.

Calling something crazy usually halts further consideration and conversation. After all, "you can't fix crazy." So what good does it do to think about it? Is it even craziness? Or is it human nature? Is it what we have been pleased to call the human condition? That is what most religion and philosophy say. Nothing overcomes nature. So they render themselves helpless by their own pronouncements. Also, they excuse themselves.

Conventional psychology has failed to fix our craziness. And psychological reformers have proven ineffective. They consign their tough cases to psychiatry, surrendering to its worship of drugs. It is the further medical application of our culture's mythos of original sin. In other words, debilitation, incompetence, failure, and suffering are human nature. We refuse further examination of causes. Mass psychosis is the biggest elephant in our room. 

I submit, we are actually crazy. But we weren't always. Something went terribly wrong and here we are. Happily, we are alive. Therefore we are self-healing. So somehow we can recover.

What would we recover? Common sense, memory, and honesty. Joy and empathy. Vigor and grace---for starters. Much more awaits us. When thinking, feeling, and moving centers of intelligence function again, and in harmony with each other, life will improve to a degree known only in legend.[^4]

Harmonious function will come from re-engagement with the other basic plane of reality: timespace. Some cutting edge scientists call it this because it mirrors spacetime. Timespace has three dimensions of time---past, present, future---that one can choose from, and one, unchoosable dimension of space, that is, one location per moment in time.[^5] Australian Aboriginals call it dreamtime. Kogi Indians call it the _aluna_. 

They access it at will for daily living. It is how they can track someone 100 miles through the desert a year later with only a scrap of his clothing. Or talk to people on the other side of the world without telephones. Or go out to meet a scarce deer in the middle of nowhere and bring it back for food. It is how spiritual adepts famously know things they have no normal way of knowing.

Dreamtime is perceived primarily through the feeling center of intelligence, not the senses. It is intuition. With psychic integrity, it can be just as precise and accessible as the eyes aided by microscope or telescope, or a camera on a drone.

The feeling center, being more fragile than the sensorium and less aggressive than intellect, rarely works well among us civilized people. So to scientific materialists, dreamtime doesn't exist. They dismiss it out of hand despite millennia of evidence. Which even most civilized people have some of. Knowing someone specific is about to call is common. Such strange experiences stick in one's mind, unexplained for decades like personal X-files. If you talk about this stuff in conventional settings, others will call you crazy. But if you rest in darkness long enough, access to it reopens and promises to return permanently.

I will not dwell on something that is so unusual that you must see it for yourself, as you will in darkness. But this vast and rich side of life that we largely miss must cease going unremarked in psychology and hygiene. It is stupid and embarrassing. The academy likes to ignore the two other (greater) bodies of human knowledge: the spiritual and the indigenous. We will not.

By my rough estimation, we are currently functioning at 2% of capacity. In other words, things with us are as bad as they can get while still allowing us to raise children to reproductive age. To embellish the idea, at 1%, you're institutionalized; 0%, dead. In the opposite direction, at 3%, you're a local hero; 4%, famous; 5%, a national star; 10%, a genius; 20%, a saint; and 30-40%, a messiah. 

The greatest people in our history had to lower their level of functioning from a normal 90-100% just so we could bear their presence. But what did each of them say, one way or another? _All this and more ye shall do._ This is our task. The first person to raise from the dead is oneself.

The hygienic view of health and sanity is the brain of this approach. Darkroom retreating is the gut---the action. The testimony of mass functional psychosis is its broken heart. My essay online, [psychosis](/conjecture/psychosis), written in the heat of insight, conveys it purely and forcefully.

### cataclysm

Pathology is the study of illness, especially its etiology: the chain of cause and effect that leads to symptoms. 

Hygiene is radical because it deals unflinchingly in first causes. It begins by observing that health is the normal state of organisms under normal conditions. Life itself started out in integrity and health. Nature cannot generate a diseased species. Disease only occurs when something goes wrong with conditions, when harmful ones are present and beneficial ones are absent or in disproportion. 

This gives hygiene a rational standard for evaluating conditions proposed as beneficial. Hygiene asks, what normal relationship to life does this condition have? Did its absence cause the disease in the first place? If not, then its presence won't correct matters and we can dismiss the proposal.

In the case of using darkness to heal from psychic illness, well, once upon a time, we _were_ deprived the shelter we instinctively sought in order to heal from whatever traumatized us. We got hurt but got no chance to heal. Resting in a darkroom finally addresses this little-noticed intermediate cause of ongoing suffering and illness.

Why were we deprived? One way or another, our parents, our source of shelter, were also the source of our trauma. Busy inflicting one, they could not provide the other very well. It is the absolute worst, most taboo, most terrible truth we all know and spend most of our lives avoiding. I am sorry.

Of course, they suffered similar trauma at the hands of their parents. It rendered most of them incapable of providing us such shelter. It compelled their antipathy toward us. They denied us rest just as they denied their own need for rest, just as their parents conditioned them to, just as their parents were equally traumatized, denied, and conditioned, going back 400 generations. On this level, everyone is innocent.

However, everyone exists on many levels, not just such abstract and eternal ones. On a concrete and immediate level, all parents remain 100% responsible for what they did and did not to children in their care. Only by viewing parents as responsible can we become responsible parents ourselves. Otherwise the double burden is too much. Those who shield their parents from justice, even privately, inevitably unload the injustice they suffered upon their own children.

Major trauma injures, shocks, and disorients everyone concerned. One gets lost in the slow-motion nightmare of its infliction. Who deals the wound and who sustains it? Who was helpless and who was at fault? Of course grown-ups start it with kids. But kids feel it is their fault. Lines blur and before they know it, people have become their parents and the cycle begins again.

How did the snowball of trauma begin? 

People reproduce to continue themselves. Thus sane people do not hurt their children. Nature does not generate diseased species. Man had to have started off alright. The self-correcting instinct of healthy animals is too strong to violate merely by will or persist in by accident. Life pulls us back onto the right track no less than other animals---when we're healthy. This means psychophysically intact.

The trauma had to have originated externally. It had to be _huge_ to knock so many of us so far off course and disable us so badly we couldn't begin returning for so long. Major trauma to an individual or one group would not be enough to do this. Individuals would be helped back to health. In disaster trauma, groups are aided by neighbors or even foreigners. We must think bigger. The psychoanalyst Immanuel Velikovsky, who turned his eye to archaeology and comparative mythology, found the mind-boggling scale of our emergency.

A global cataclysm in our distant past must have started it. It wrecked everything in one stroke for entire continents of people, so that there was no one left to help. It seems to have been the Biblical flood. Much evidence points to one 12,980 years ago. But perhaps it was multiple super-volcanoes due to seismic shift from celestial influences. A pole-shift that swept continents with earthquakes and tsunamis. A comet strike. A war between the gods or alien invasion. Whatever it was, the result was _cataclysmic trauma_.

Cataclysmic trauma is comprehensive. It kills many people and most elders, who would best manage things. It injures most of the rest. Neighbors cannot help. Everyone for thousands of kilometers is suddenly in the same dire straits. Infrastructure is lost: shelter, food, water, habitat. The landscape shifts, becomes dangerous. Climate itself changes. A lifeway's entire basis is wiped out, including day to day survival.

Going into caves to rest and heal is common among undomesticated people and animals. But even if someone left knows to do it and a cave remains accessible, too many people need it for longer than it is comfortable. All the supportive systems are gone. People have no chance to heal. They only have what is left inside them. The young tend to survive, but they are less stable psychically, with less wisdom to temper the damage. Life, which had been abundant, pleasant, and easy, becomes a grim battle to survive.

Such a disaster causes psychic trauma and malfunction in nearly everyone. Mass psychosis begins.

In this barren hell, where can people find comfort? In each others' arms, of course. Voluntary birth control, common among indigenous people, is lost with many other subtle capacities. Babies start arriving. Cataclysmic trauma starts its terrible transmission through the generations. 

Trauma changes form but keeps its intensity. Society rearranges itself into civilization to absorb the cosmic blow. Apparently a pathocracy, it quietly finds slightly less harmful ways to distribute and pass on the shock. As horrible as things frequently get, still it is the best we can do. Technology compensates for lost capacity. Quietly, life keeps generating seekers to find out the truth of what is happening. Clue by clue, understanding is assembled over hundreds of generations. At last, the truth dawns.

What if we are the butt of a bad cosmic joke? If so, then our wars, big and small, are pointless. No one started it. No one need be punished. Everyone is essentially innocent. Everyone is free to walk away from the conflict and heal. 

Trauma from such large-scale events is unavoidable. It is natural. Trying to prevent it is futile. Hope lies in having a way to recover from it.[^6][^7]

### hygienic psychology

In light of the essence of hygiene, _conditional self-preservation_; the restful use of darkness; and the cataclysmic origin of disease, a hygienic psychology can now be outlined:

1. As organisms, we start out in health: in joy, power, and genius.
2. Early major psychic trauma from civilization's routine brutality (originating in ancient cataclysm) leaves us damaged, malfunctioning, and suffering.
3. The psyche, as an organic system, is self-healing, provided the proper conditions.
4. The primary condition of healing is profound rest.
5. Rest that is profound enough for healing from major trauma occurs in total darkness.
6. By hygienic darkroom retreating, we gain relief, rest, and recovery of health and its attributes.

Hygiene upholds basic findings of psychology from several traditions. Hygiene merely declines psychology's conscious over-involvement in the unconscious. Only the unconscious is competent to direct self-healing. It only needs support of the conscious. The conscious is helpless to fix the damage. We are correct in believing we have a problem and need to do something about it. We have been disastrously incorrect about which part of the self has to do it.[^8]

#### fasting

Focusing on profound psychic rest in absolute darkness is new in hygiene. Due to its naive pathology, it has focused on the profound physiological rest of fasting. Fasting has been hygiene's ultimate means of dealing with serious illness. At most, hygiene recommends keeping curtains and eyes closed during fasts. This reduces the significant work of sensory processing of vision[^9]. A darkroom retreat embodies this principle fully. It provides the energy and, frankly, the psychic security of food, until the underlying psychic system necessary for comfortable fasting has repaired itself.

In other words, the psychic system is more fundamental than the digestive and eliminative systems. Darkroom retreating is thus more urgently needed than fasting in most cases.

Furthermore, darkroom retreating is safer to begin with than fasting. In darkness, awareness of internal sensations and their meanings becomes clear and fine-grained. Motivation to learn hygiene grows. 

Fasting requires psychic integrity, self-knowledge, and a thorough grasp of hygiene in general and fasting in particular. Thus hygienic darkroom retreating will open the door to unsupervised long fasts on a wide scale.

Professional hygienic fasting supervisors attempt to substitute themselves for these prerequisites of fasting. Or they teach them in the usual slow, incomplete way. Consequently, only hundreds of people fast per year in a good way, not the billions who need to. Only a few decent fasting retreat centers exist. 

Hygienic darkroom retreating recontexualizes fasting. Supervisors become supporters, trainers, and remote consultants. Retreating in darkness themselves, they will regain the capacity to operate at a global scale, not just with the lucky few.

#### miracle

Dark retreating is like fasting. The process is quiet and gradual. Usually, one knows that something is happening, but not what. It's like the subterranean rumbling of a subway.

Sometimes, one must participate consciously in the process. One finds out _why_ his life has gone wrong. One sees what part of his thinking and behavior must change.

In any case, one always knows the result: restoration of function. It is the recovery of a lost part of self. Confidence, contentedness, presence, and euphoria naturally accompany it. Hygienic darkroom retreating reveals the marvelous self-healing power of the organism under proper conditions.

For those who have suffered for years and failed with other approaches, the process is nothing less than miraculous. It is typical with hygiene. Time in darkness shows that if one wants a miracle, one need only provide its conditions.

And then? Healed from trauma, one will no longer be compelled to repeat it. One will absorb and redeem its history and consequences. One heals retroactively. One not only feels good now. All the years of agony somehow turn to joy. It is strange to write this to you, probably stranger for you to read it without the experience. But there you have it. That is what happens.

The organism in darkness becomes like a time machine for returning to the present. Or a space ship for traveling to Earth. Or, as in ancient legends, the:

- Fountain of Youth, for restoring supreme health
- Garden of Eden, where one feels at home 
- Golden Fleece, by which one regains natural personal power
- Holy Grail, source of joy and wisdom
- Panacea[^10], genius for solving all problems
- Philosopher's Stone, key to the infinite wealth of nature

Typical of hygiene, the bad news of hygienic psychology is far worse than anyone imagined, and its good news, far better.

### conclusion

In this book, we have seen four significant developments in hygiene:

1. the maturation of hygiene's laws
2. the emergence of a hygienic psychology
3. the radicalization of hygienic pathology by the identification of trauma as the root of all illness
4. the greater importance of dark retreats than fasting for resting and healing

These have massive implications for hygiene's destiny, and mankind's as well.

Hygiene has said illness originates with enervation (exhaustion) and toxemia (poisoning). Its new pathology explains how these conditions themselves originate in trauma. In gaining the ability to deal with trauma, hygiene can finally obsolete allopathy (medicine) in its stronghold. 

I discuss these implications further in [hygiene notes](/conjecture/hygiene-notes). I am only saying enough here to give you a solid basis for beginning with hygienic darkroom retreating. If it makes sense to you and you like what happens, further study is natural. For a thorough introduction to hygiene's principles, practices, and intriguing history, read Shelton's [*Science and Fine Art of Natural Hygiene*](/f/hygiene.pdf)\*.
