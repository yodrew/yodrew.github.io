The tricky part of making a darkroom is not darkening it but ventilating it. After all, now its windows and doors are sealed. So we'll address ventilation first.

Silencing a room is even trickier. But we have a couple aces up our sleeve for that.

We need to understand how ventilation works so we can design a good system. Ventilation affects both the silence and temperature of a darkroom. We will examine each of these conditions, then see how they work together in a mechanical system. Then we will make the components of the system.

### ventilation

This section is on ventilation in general. I will give design constraints and describe various systems. But first, I will address its physiological importance.

#### breathe

Nature gives us a constant, abundant supply of fresh air. Our buildings should, too.

I have observed a shocking number of people who seem oblivious to their own need for fresh air. Everyone knows we die within minutes without air. Yet the importance of a continuous fresh supply of it has escaped many. 

I can only attribute this negligence to mass psychosis. It is my stock explanation for the appalling features of civilized life. The need for fresh air is one of the most basic, most obvious facts of life. At the risk of insulting your intelligence, I am bound to address it.

Fresh air is always important. It is a normal condition of life. Along with warmth and safety, it is one of our most urgent necessities. Every second of our lives, quintillions of organic processes occur. Virtually all of them require oxygen. It is the most important nutrient we consume. We can live days without water and weeks without food. Not so, air.

Just like food, air becomes a part of one's organism. It affects quality of life to a very great degree. It seems like nothing. But the amount of air you breathe masses twice as much as the food you eat. In a darkroom, you have little to do besides breathe. If you haven't paid attention to air quality, you will notice it in darkness. 

Even if you don't, poor air quality cancels most benefits of a retreat. Intermittently airing the room out _does not work_. I mean opening the door a couple times a day with eyes covered. Put this approach out of your mind. This is darkness, not the dark ages. Whatever it takes, no matter where you are or what you are doing, always provide yourself with continuous fresh air. 

For a darkroom retreat, this means:

1. following the instructions below
2. hiring an HVAC contractor to clean, repair, replace, or install ventilation in your home
3. moving somewhere the ventilation system just works (like the tropics or a new house in northern Europe)
4. using houseplants: [high oxygen producers](https://www.ted.com/talks/kamal_meattle_on_how_to_grow_your_own_fresh_air/transcript?language=en) and [air-purifiers](https://www.tipsbulletin.com/plants-that-clean-the-air/)
5. a combination of these

Somehow, it must be done. Forget darkness a moment. We rarely have a more urgent concern in life than arranging to breathe fresh air continuously and comfortably. Keeping it foremost in your thinking about darkroom design and construction will help ensure a successful retreat.

Not freezing to death and avoiding danger are more urgent than continuous fresh air. Building systems can meet all these needs harmoniously. Unaddressed fear and ignorance result in design conflicts between them. For example, we still often depend on windows for ventilation instead of a proper, separate system. The rest of this chapter will help you avoid such errors.

#### constraints

- system provides plenty of fresh air
- absolutely lightproof
- silent: absolutely no hum or harmonics from fan and exterior noises mostly extinguished
- comfortable temperature: no undesired cold drafts
- economical: ie, no wasted heat to the outdoors. This is more involved and a lower priority than retreating itself, so don't get stuck on it. It requires a heat recovery ventilator (HRV). Besides significantly lowering heating costs, an HRV improves air quality and comfort in nearly all climates. More about it below.

#### system

Somehow, fresh air has to get into the darkroom and stale air has to get out, without letting in noise or light.

In the terms of the HVAC industry (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning), the fresh air vent is the _supply_ and the stale air vent is the _return_.

Sometimes, supply and return vents exist in the same room. This is the fanciest version of _balanced_ mechanical ventilation. If your place has it, thank your lucky stars. Just make sure it runs continuously. Unless your room is huge, intermittent is not good enough.

More commonly, balanced systems put supplies in bedrooms and living rooms, and returns in kitchens and bathrooms. This means air escapes a bedroom around the door. Unless the space outside the door is totally dark, this calls for a _threshold_ lightproof vent (plans below).

Balanced systems are rare. More common are negative pressure systems: bedroom and living room windows act as passive supplies and bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans as active returns. In this case, a lightproof multi-purpose _helix_ vent, built into a window blind, is the supply. Or a silencer if noise surrounds your dwelling. A threshold vent is the return, letting stale air escape the bedroom to the exhaust fan.

Rooms with totally passive ventilation rely on open windows, exterior vents, and infiltration through cracks. These will get sealed against light. Such rooms will need helix vents in blinds at different heights to take advantage of convection. But they probably call for a fan and a silencer, maybe ducting.

By closely observing buildings I have discovered some simple ways to ventilate them. Sometimes rooms have lightproof and sound-dampened holes built into them in unexpected places:

- unused holes for pipes, wires, chimneys, and ventilation. 
- behind a cupboard or inside a closet
- a removable panel or wide piece of trim that could be temporarily replaced with a panel with a hole in it. 

For example, I once salvaged a cosmetically damaged door from the garbage at a building supply store exactly the same size as my darkroom's door. So I stored the original door and cut holes in the damaged door for ventilation. 

Another darkroom had no ventilation or suitable holes anywhere. It also had no door. So we built a frame inside the doorway with a narrow door on one side and a narrower panel on the other. We cut holes in the panel for ventilation ducts. We fixed the frame in the existing doorway with metal straps screwed into old hinge holes. When dismantling the darkroom, we left no trace.

Similarly, we hung 7m of ducting that ran through three rooms; attached a silencer to it; made three window panels; and imperfectly covered five more windows with only one new screw hole in the entire rented house. And that hole was invisible behind a loose piece of trim. "Leave no trace" is a fun game that often improves design.

Sewage pipes drain downward but are ventilated upward. Once, friends and I replaced a flush toilet with a composting toilet. The exposed drain pipe, being oversize and in a single-story house, wasn't subject to backflow. So it proved a perfect exhaust duct for a case fan at floor level. Imagination conquers all obstacles (and renews itself in darkness).

If you are building a new house or are at liberty with an existing one, separate ventilation from windows. Give it its own holes in walls. This improves many attributes of a shelter: security, economy, comfort, silence, darkenability, and overall control.

### vent

Here are further design constraints, photos, plans, and instructions for making and installing lightproof vents.

#### constraints

(helix / helix-z  specifications in parentheses)  
{threshold vent specifications in curly braces}

- durable (protected by cardboard shell or silencer){protected by wood reinforcement, subject to damage by kicking but easily rebuilt, could be made of sheet metal or shielded with cardboard or thin wooden boards}
- thin enough to fit between blind and window (<80mm) or door and threshold {adjustable}
- cross-sectional area >78cm<sup>2</sup> (85cm<sup>2</sup>){60--120cm<sup>2</sup>} to equal standard 100mm diameter ducting
- fully traps light, sending light around at least 5 corners (7 corners / 5 corners){2-6 fabric-covered corners} 
- short airway (240mm / 160){140mm} 
- minimal size (220 x 77 x 290 / 140 x 67 x 281){fits under door, sticks out 20mm each side and up 60mm}
- easy to make (so-so){yes}
- elegant (yes: simple compact form, uses common materials, zig-zag-shaped passage accommodates natural helical movement of air){yes}
- cheap ($4 in materials, 2-hour assembly time){$2 in materials, 1-hour assembly time}

#### helix

I call it a helix vent because of how air actually moves through it: like a corkscrew. It might look like air would zigzag through like light. But air is a fluid like water. It takes the path of least resistance. It maintains the same curved trajectory by _helixing_ through. The helix is the natural form of fluids in motion under any circumstance. So this minimizes friction within the airstream as well.

<!--pagebreak-->

The helix vent can go anywhere: a blind, a door, a wall, etc. Flaps of either opening poke through a slot and get taped or glued down. Mostly it attaches to a blind with the face opening. Put fleece seal on the side opening if attaching it there.

- blind: attach it to a blind and slightly open the window behind it. 
- door: cut slot in it and use helix vent instead of a threshold vent. 
- existing vent through a wall: in a cardboard box, cut hole the same size as the existing vent. Cut a slot on the opposite side of the box for a helix vent. Attach helix vent to box and box to wall over existing vent. Vent can be either supply or return.
- silencer
	- inside or outside, attached at face or side opening. 
	- z version: simpler, more efficient, higher capacity version especially for inside the silencer. Short and straight, it has fewer light-stopping corners and no shell. It is only for installing inside the silencer or other enclosure with two or more corners for light to go around. See drawings in next section.

If your darkroom's ventilation is passive, put vents both low and high in room to enable convection. This works better the greater the inside and outside temperature difference; the greater the vertical distance between vents; and the more vents. 

Do you wish to manufacture vents? A set of simple wooden or sheet metal templates and jigs can speed production tremendously while keeping equipment and investment to a minimum. Start in your garage.

Materials are simple and non-toxic: heavy black acid-free paper, cardboard, fabric, and wood glue. Look in art or office supply shops for the paper. North Americans, common posterboard meets the standard. If unsure, use this paper weight and size [conversion chart](https://www.paper-paper.com/weight.html). If large sheets are unavailable, glue small sheets together between folds in plan. Wood glue has high tack and quick drying time, easing assembly. School glue works, too.

Read through instructions once while studying plans.

1. materials (see plans for quantities)
	1. paper (for channels and walls)
		- black, acid-free bond, coverstock
		- available at art supply, stationery, and book shops. In Europe, common posterboard is usually acid-free, Canson Iris, for example.
		- 2 sheets (550 x 700) per vent
		- weight: 120--400gsm (200 ideal)
	2. cardboard, 5mm thick for shell (plan must be adjusted for different thickness)
	3. fabric: polar fleece, black, medium weight for seal. (Quality check: 10 layers of it in a stack should measure 30-35mm high)
2. follow instructions in [fabricate](/make#fabricate) 
3. glue channels to inner and outer shells
		1. figure out how parts go together. Note that channel plan is oriented to shell plan, including the direction of folds and lettered joint points and lines
		3. mock up assembly by taping parts together till you've got everything right.
		4. glue lettered lines first. Use a 2mm bead, ie, as little glue as possible, minimizing warping  
3. glue ends to channel tabs
5. assemble
	1. bend shell ends up. Trim them to match outer ends.
	2. position halves for joining
	3. test joints
		- align corners of inner and outer shells
		- match letters
		- inner ends go inside outer ends
		- note how notches of inner ends fit around outer ridges
		- practice using table knife to press ends together when you glue them
	4. glue inner ends to outer ends, using table knives
	5. glue shell seals on shell corners
	6. glue halves together, one end at a time using table knives
	7. glue long shell seals on joints between halves
5. shell
	- glue on fleece seal 
	- before installation, tape flaps over openings
6. installation
	1. determine vent location 
		- in blind, panel, or silencer
		- whether it will attach at side or face opening
		- shell is unnecessary when installed inside silencer or other enclosure
		- vent should not touch window handles, locks, or frame 
	2. mark slot with slot plan
		- the slot plan spaces slot correctly on most blinds and panels
		- face opening, 35 x 281, on blinds, panels, or outside silencer, with shell
		- side opening, 32 x 281, inside silencer or other enclosure, without shell
	3. cut out slot
	4. position vent over slot and fit vent flaps through it
	5. when attaching to soft window covering like fabric, plastic sheeting, or cardboard, pull long flap snug, use back of table knife tip to crease the outside of it right where it passes through slot
	6. fold flap at crease and tape it to cover. Tape makes vent removable. Only glue it in place if you are certain of not moving it for years.
	7. repeat with other long flap, then with short flaps
	8. tape or 
	9. cover shell with foil and/or white paper to minimize warping by sun

#### helix-z

This is a shorter version of the helix vent with no shell. It goes inside a silencer or other enclosure. Which gives it protection and two or more corners that light must go around. Follow instructions for helix vent above, adapting as necessary. 

Only assembly is shown. Click links to get full size plans of elevation, channel, inner wall, and outer wall. They are also in the [zip file](/darkroom-retreat.zip).

#### threshold

A bedroom door often has a gap at the bottom---the threshold---for ventilation. The threshold vent lets air through there but no light in. Its design adapts to door width, door thickness, and gap under the door between 12-33.

If the gap is greater than 33, add cardboard or wood to bottom of door or build up threshold with boards. Or modify the design. If less than 12, trim bottom of door. Otherwise, or if bottom of door fits into a stepped threshold, vent will not work. 

I once adapted the idea by splitting the vent in half so it was on one side of a door. On the other was a 100 wide board on edge across a hallway floor 20 away from bottom of door. 

Block light outside the door as much as possible. Maybe you need to darken a path between darkroom and bathroom. Cover windows in the hallway. Make a curtain across it with a dark blanket fixed to the walls and ceiling with tape or tacks.

Or make a [removable partition](https://andrewdurham.shutterfly.com/313). It's a wooden frame a little wider than the hallway so it wedges in place at an angle. It has a fleece seal around the frame. It is filled with black plastic sheeting. It is penetrated by ducting or helix vents as needed.

The drawings below are of a vent for a typical door, 750 *w*ide x 40 *t*hick, and a *g*ap underneath of 20.

1. materials
	- paper, black, acid-free, 400-600gsm
	- dowel or stick, 10 diameter, or popsicle sticks
	- fabric, black: muslin and fleece
2. prepare pattern with instructions in [fabricate](/make#fabricate)
3. blacken interior of ends (grey area) with marker
4. key (example measurements in parentheses)

	- _v_: vent width (426)
	- _e_: end of vent to edge of door (162)
5. cover threshold with black paper: _w_ + 40 x _t_ + 70; trim ends (790 x 110)
6. cover part of door inside vent with black muslin: _v_ + 20 x _t_ + 150 (446 x 190)
7. cover underside of vent with black fleece + 20mm up the walls: _v_ + 40 x _t_ + 80 (486 x 140). Glue it just to the walls, not the bottom for best seal.
8. attach fabric/paper
	- to door and threshold with tape
	- to vent with glue 
9. glue dowel or stick, or popsicle sticks in 2 offset layers, to tops of walls under flanges. Press flat with a board and weights till dry. Fold flanges down over sticks and glue.
10. fold up walls and ends to make a box
11. tape flaps to outside of vent body (undo to store vent flat)
12. tape vent to door at triangular flaps
13. make fleece baffle: _e_ + 10 x _t_/2 + 2*g* + 40 (172 x 100)  
The baffle fills in spaces at ends of vent. Tape top edges of fleece 20mm above bottom of door. Baffle is 5 wider than the space on each end to seal against vent and door jam. Cut away any fleece that interferes with [door seal](/darkness#door-seal). If baffle drags out of position, weight it with a strip of cardboard inside:  
_e_ x _t_/3. (162 x 13)
14. if light comes through vent, make a roof for one or both openings. Line with black fabric. Glue stick over flange. Tape to door by the flaps.

### soundproofing

#### principles

Shelter must [control exposure](/design#normal) to pollution. Noise is a form of pollution. Noise comes from outside from machines, traffic---including boats, trains, and airplanes---construction, music, fireworks, and talking and playing people. It comes from inside from machines---refrigerators, fans, water pipes and pumps), people in adjoining spaces, and their music. At some point, noise defeats a retreat. One must attenuate it somehow, even in remote locations.

The four principles of soundproofing are: 

1. mass: heavy materials absorb low-frequency (bass) sounds
2. absorption: fine fibers absorb high frequencies and prevent echoing in air cavities
3. dampening: using rubbery material to dampen vibration in resonant materials like metal, wood, masonry, glass
4. decoupling: disconnect structures and airspaces to prevent transmission of sound vibration from source to receiver

[Soundproofing tutorials](https://bit.ly/soundproofingtutor) abound online. 

These principles apply to ventilation as well. Dampening and decoupling figure in the fan mount, mass and absorption, in the silencer. The silencer eliminates most noise, including from the fan.

Fans make noise directly and indirectly. Small fans have little hum to start with, but they run at high speed, so they develop harmonics. Bigger fans start with more of a hum but they run more slowly for the same air output, so they develop less noise overall. Use fan mount below to avoid amplifying these vibrations.

Even the quietest fan makes noise because of the friction of air itself against the fan blades, housing, ducting, and vents. Because of air friction, fully silencing a ventilation system requires a silencer of some type at the room-ends of ducts. 

#### silencer

A silencer is an larger duct section lined with insulation. Its greater volume depressurizes the airstream. This transforms low-frequency sound into into high-frequency sound. High-frequencies vibrate the fine fibers lining the silencer, transforming the sound into heat. Genius!

You can make or buy silencers. 

- my double-turn box design is below, $2-$10 depending on your material salvaging skills.
- [DIY straight tube design](https://www.420magazine.com/community/threads/diy-duct-silencer-muffler-super-cheap.176589/) 
- [for sound booths](https://bit.ly/silencerbooth). With dark insulation and enough bends, this eliminates the need for a lightproof vent.
- manufactured silencers are made of metal and other super durable materials and cost $100-200.
- [acoustic ducting](https://www.google.com/search?q=acoustic+ducting), at least 3m of 100mm with 2-3 bends

Silencers and acoustic ducting are standard industrial components, making buildings quiet worldwide. Thanks to Richard Nöjd of Skattungbyn, Sweden, for pointing out these cool solutions. 

I built silencers into window recesses on two occasions. They were simpler and more effective than I hoped. They swallowed up sound. The window, open at one end, provided one face of the box. The thick wall provided 4 sides. Boards against the inside of security bars formed the box's outer face, about 20cm from the glass. Shredded fabric insulation lined the box. This technique disables the window as a light source. It is a temporary solution. It works if you have other windows you can uncover during transition days.

The design below is a zig-zag channel through insulation inside a wooden box with a hole at each end. Each hole has 4 possible locations: face, sides, or end. Cut a circle for ducting or fan, a slot for a helix vent. The fan mount adapts to all 4 locations, inside or out.

The box is lined with porous non-toxic insulation. clean wool, shredded fabric, wood fiber could all work. Note, the shredded fabric and wood fiber I've tried had faint smells that I disliked. 

![plan: silencer](/img/plan/image/silencer.png)

plan: silencer - [download](/img/plan/silencer.pdf)

Rockwool works. It is unpleasant to work with, but it is fairly odorless. Polyester pillow filling and quilt batting and acoustic foam work. But I don't like my air going through plastic.

Fiberglass is terrible to work with and often smells of chemicals. Closed cell foam, like styrofoam, polyisocyanurate boards, camping pads, etc, does not work due to non-porosity.

Discarded furniture is made of melamine, an excellent material for silencer boxes. It is particle board with resin veneer, usually 15 or 19mm thick. Marine plywood uses non-toxic glue. Otherwise, avoid plywood or line with foil or mylar. 

Use a table saw to cut the 8 pieces so they come out square. Or have a carpenter do it for you, including the holes. Just take the drawing with you, modified for your needs. The carpenter probably has some extra melamine laying around to sell you cheap. To screw pieces together, first drill pilot holes so edges don't break. I always drill pilot holes in wood less than 30mm wide for this reason.

To insulate, make round tubes of plastic screen. Cover with porous fabric if insulation is fine, like cellulose. Stuff insulation around it and close the box. Roughen the plastic surface first with sandpaper so the glue sticks. 

#### hum

People all over the world have reported hearing a strange hum. Its source is rarely found. In Europe, I heard it in many places.

The hum is a low-frequency sound and vibration that comes through the air and ground. My first explanation was that all the machines we use combined generate this hum. This includes cars, trains, airplanes, factories, ventilation (ironically), underground pumps (whose sound carries far), farm machinery, etc. 

Most people can't hear it. I talked to a famous musician in Australia. She knew people worldwide who had heard it. She said it tends to occur in people who feel their internal conflict and disconnection acutely but cannot resolve or repair it yet. They still project responsibility for their suffering on the world at large. It's not all in one's head, but one is too vulnerable due to an error in attitude.

I had started to suspect something like this. She already had it nailed.

In Czech Republic, I visited a large music recording studio in the middle of Brno on a busy street. It was 8m x 14m inside with a 4m ceiling. The engineer let me lie on the floor in the dark for 10 minutes. I don't recall if I was hearing the hum at that time. Their building technique was extremely effective in stopping the deafening noise outside.

They called it "house-in-house". In America, "room within a room". My brother had mentioned building a few music studios like this. The walls and ceilings of each structure don't touch. The inner room's floor "floats" on vibration-dampening springs or rubber blocks. 

Then I visited an anechoic chamber at the Petrof Piano Factory in Hradec Kralove. It was extreme soundproofing! It was a 6m concrete cube, resting on leaf springs inside another building, with a 1m gap between the two. One stepped over a gap between the two, as in a subway, through a 1.2m thick door. Cones of foam 1m long protruded from the ceiling, walls, door, and floor. Suspended in the middle was a steel grill platform for a piano and engineer. With no measurable noise or echo inside, they could test a piano's sound with extreme precision.

You have probably heard of these rooms. People claim to start going crazy. That is hype. The silence was heavenly. I would have happily stayed inside for a week. 

The engineer was kind enough to give me 10 minutes. Sigh.

Anyway, the house-in-house technique is practical for silencing bedrooms for darkrooms. The gap between the houses must be at least 50mm all around. The floated floor is 12-19mm plywood on a frame, insulated and sheathed. Walls and ceiling are also insulated frames with drywall on both sides. Dual pane windows, airtight door seals, and silenced ventilation complete the construction.

### machines

#### fan

Use an axial case fan, also known as a squirrel cage fan. Most common in desktop computers. Specifications:

- DC (direct current)
- 12V (volts) but run on as little as 6V, reducing speed, noise, and airflow
- 120--200mm diameter
- 600--1200RPM (revolutions per minute)
- maximum 20dB (decibels)
- 65--200cmh (cubic meters per hour) or 40--120cfm (cubic feet per minute)

I recommend 200mm fans. I redesigned the fan mount for them rather than the 120mm fans I used for years. They move a lot of air and are very quiet. I have Cooler Master brand. Noctua makes the best and quietest fans available, running as low as 7dB.

However, a common 120mm fan is better than nothing. It usually requires a silencer. It is salvageable from a desktop computer power supply, $3 at thrift stores or flea markets, or $5--40 at a computer or electronics store. Avoid AC (alternating current) fans due to their penetrating hum (more on noise below). 

Power it from the grid with an AC/DC adapter. 12V case fans run on as little as 6V. A universal adapter with pole switching and variable voltage (3-12V) for speed control is $5-10 at variety stores. Thrift stores have boxes of cheap adapters of fixed voltage if you know what voltage you want. 

Off grid, use car or household batteries or a solar power system. To control speed, use a DC/DC car adapter from eBay. If you have no fan movement? Switch the +/-- poles on the adapter or switch the positive and negative wires.

Blower fans are interesting. They overcome resistance in ducts and HRVs and move a ton of air. 120mm units on eBay are $10-20. They need silencers and more powerful adapters. Larger slower quieter ones would be better. I built one once. It took a lot of time!

#### fan mount

The fan mount totally dampens vibration from the fan, already smooth and quiet. The silencer then absorbs airborne noise from the fan. It is inspired by studio microphones and tensegrity structures. It fits the silencer.

The design is fairly self-explanatory:

- description
	- a fan suspended in a web of 2 concentric rings of rubber, stretched between 4 screw posts, anchored in a wooden base
	- modular, fitting silencer in any configuration
- materials
	- base: 272 x 272 x 19 (center hole, 194 diameter). Cut precisely with jig, band, or coping saw; router; or have a carpenter do it for you. Screw hole centers 20 from corners
	- case fan: 200 (computer fan)
	- screws: 4@5 x 60 machine + 4 nuts + 4 T-nuts, 4 fender washers
	- rubber: 1-2 thick, 28 wide, 1700 long. Use inner tube of car, motorcycle, or bicycle wheel. It is tricky to work out distances between loops so that rubber has enough tension to suspend fan without too much movement. Loops and buckle make it all adjustable.
	- loop: wire, 1mm, bent to fit tight 
	- gap: 0.5--1 between base and fan
- assembly
	- lay out rubber strip.
	- figure out order to slide loops on. Do so.
	- add buckle
	- tighten and adjust rubber
	- fit fan with foam standouts into rubber
	- align fan directly over the hole in base. Gravity may pull it to one side or another. Tug on fan or webbing to reposition fan.
	- slide webbing up or down screws to adjust base-fan gap
	- screw base onto silencer over a hole in any position

#### power

In my first major darkroom in Guatemala, I had no electricity.

At first, to create a draft, I made lamps that burned cooking oil inside a lightproof chimney. It was a messy, unreliable, and labor-intensive process. No one should ever repeat it. But it worked long enough for my brain to make the leap to the 20th century and remember the existence of batteries.

AA batteries made a quick and dirty solution. One night requires 4-8 batteries, alkaline or rechargeable. Connect them in series: positive end of one to negative end of the next. 

Voltage adds up like this. Each battery is 1.5V, so 4 batteries=6V. Some fans need 7V or 9V to start, thus 5 or 6 batteries. Increase fan speed by adding batteries to the pack, up to 8. Increase pack life by using bigger batteries or another series in parallel (fan wires contacting ends of both series).

I was isolated and just learning. This simple discovery encouraged me after weeks of the fascinating absurdity of oil lamp-driven convective ventilation. However, changing batteries every day also quickly got to be a pain. So I bit the bullet and got a proper solar power system for less than $100:

* solar panel: 12V. Size depends on location: 10W in Guatemala, 40W in rainy Oregon winter. ($10--$100 on eBay)
* charge controller: 12V, 4 or 6-pole ($35 on eBay)
* battery: 12V 7A, lead acid ($30 at a motorcycle shop)
* wire, 20 AWG, enough to connect everything ($0--10 from your shed, a dumpster, yard sale, or hardware store).

Once built, maintain by wiping dust off panel once a week. What a luxury! Of course, if you have reliable wind or hydro power, that's great, too.

#### warmth

For warmth, I often use a portable oil-filled electric heater. It is silent and can be positioned by a window or vent to warm incoming cold fresh air. Before buying, check that its indicator lights are easy to cover (not glowing from the interior through multiple cracks) and that it doesn't rattle or hum. Old or cheap ones often make noise. Buy it new.

If you live in a cold place, I highly recommend buying and installing a [Heat Recovery Ventilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_ventilation) (HRV) for both health and economy. It conducts heat from return air to supply air while keeping airstreams separate using an exchanging core and fans.

Fine wire heat exchange (fiwihex) technology is my favorite. It is 15x more efficient than plate exchangers. It is compact. A low power fan will supply air to one person. So it can be installed at point of use with little to no ducting. Fiwihex cores have been available for $150 from [Viking House](http://viking-house.ie) and possibly [Fresh-R](https://fresh-r.eu). These companies' _Breathing Windows_ embody an intriguing design for a complete ventilation system. 

However, I lived with one for six months and found it too loud due to its small, high-RPM fans with no silencing. If fans were separated and silenced, fiwihex would be great. A 200mm axial case fan works (I tried it). DC  blower fans could work with silencing. Building your own HRV is doable.

It also needs a filter despite the manufacturers' strange denials. Just a leg of a stocking inside a tube for each intake is enough. It's much easier to remove, clean, and replace than using the core itself as a filter (the manufacturer's strange instruction).

The most interesting plate exchangers use the Mitsubishi _Lossnay_ core, found in ERVs (Energy Recovery Ventilators) such as [Renewaire's](https://www.renewaire.com). Made of high-tech paper, the Lossnay recovers heat-trapping water vapor as well as heat from air. 

Lossnay's principle has DIY-potential, using non-siliconized parchment paper ("sandwich paper" in supermarkets). After 20 years of contemplation, I conceived a design for a convection-powered fiwihex ERV (solid state, silent). It would take a small factory to produce. Maybe someday I will.

#### purity

In some cases, an air purifier becomes necessary. If your house is near a factory, busy roads, in a smoggy city, or near a smelly restaurant or neighbor, get one. Purification methods include:

- activated carbon
- HEPA
- Photo Catalytic Oxidation ([PCO](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337316308001)) is a new, interesting technology that destroys pollutants at the molecular level. Several companies make filters with it. Prices vary widely. 
- UV-C light bulbs with 253.7nm wavelength destroys VOCs and germs and cost less than $10. These would use the regular case fan and just need a helix vent to stop light.

Do not use an ionizer. It produces toxic levels of ozone.

Recently, I upgraded the ventilation system of a darkroom in Czech Republic where people burn coal for heat. Coal smoke smells terrible. I installed an activated carbon filter into the silencer. The $50, 18 x 18 cm filter eliminated the smell. Catching the particles would require HEPA filtration, but it was less important at the time. 

The filter also stops all light and some sound. It requires a fan more powerful than a case fan to overcome the resistance it presents. A blower fan does this. I have yet to test one with a silencer. If that works, I'll adapt the fan mount for one.

If air quality at your home is bad enough, consider moving. Lots of places in small towns and the countryside have clean air and are less polluted in general. It is a cheap and simple solution to multiple problems, some of which you may not know you have yet.

That's it for lightproof ventilation, silence, power, heating, and purification. On to darkening doors and windows.
