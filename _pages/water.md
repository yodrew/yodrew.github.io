If you already have a bathroom and kitchen, great. If not, make the fixtures below. They are quick, cheap, portable, like everything I design. If basic versions are too punk rock for you, try the upgrades. Improve them incrementally as you find out the value of retreating for yourself.

### sink

#### basic

- bucket with lid, 10-25L
- 1-2L soda bottle with cap, filled with water
- loosen cap slightly
- squeeze bottle over bucket, with or without lid. Use one hand or put it between your knees for hands-free use
- wash hands or food
- slide lid off bucket to drain water into bucket
- putting food waste in the bucket helps keep the smell down

#### upgrade

- table
- rectangular plastic basin, like a restaurant bus tub
- short stand, 30h x 30 x 40cm, behind basin
- 10 or 20L bottle with valve-cap on stand
- drinking water (if separate from wash water): in 20L bottle with valve-cap
- waste (water and food): two, 20L buckets with lids

#### deluxe

- salvaged sink set in a counter-height table
- drains directly into waste bucket
- upgrade again by adding a drain tube to outside. 

### toilet

#### basic

It's a 20L bucket with a toilet seat on top (balanced or hooked somehow). No kidding.
	
- put 2 liters of sawdust in the bottom
- put 15 liters more sawdust in another bucket by the toilet
- with a scoop, put a 0.5L of sawdust in toilet after each use
- place toilet by return vent, away from bed
- disposal:
	- pour off liquid under trees and bushes
	- dump solids in a covered compost pile enclosed with wire fencing or plywood
	- dust it with dirt and cover with a 3-5cm layer of carbonaceous material like leaves, straw, sawdust	
	- also put food scraps in pile 
	- let it sit for a year before use. Make a second pile meanwhile.
	- It's that simple, but I wrote more about [composting toilets](/blog/2024/02/compost-toilet) to allay any concerns and provide more details
- replace toilet paper with water to ensure cleanliness and prevent abrasion and infection
	- get a 0.5--1L soda bottle and wash it out 
	- poke a hole through the cap at an angle with a large sewing needle
	- fill bottle with water and cap it
	- while squatting, hold bottle upside down against lower back
	- point stream forward, squeeze, and wet other hand
	- point stream at anus and wash it with wet fingers
	- realize paper never cleaned you and wonder why you ever tried performing this task that way
	- pat yourself dry with cloth or paper and be happy

#### upgrade

Here are two similar toilet designs. The first is non-separating for sitting and squatting. The second is separating and (probably) just for squatting. Features could be combined. Many instructions for first apply to second. More for second are in drawing.

The first is a wooden box with a hole in the top and maybe a toilet seat attached over the hole. A 20L bucket sits inside to poop and pee into. The room's ventilation return duct attaches to a hole in the side of the box. So all air exits the room through the toilet, removing all odor. Empty it every 3-5 days.

A [vented urinal](/report/2x3-day#mechanical-report) works for men and adventurous women (or is adaptable). A toilet that separates liquid from solids is ideal. The styrofoam "Separett" seat is common in outhouses in Sweden. 

I used a porcelain separating composting toilet there, too. It looked like a regular toilet. It cost about the same to install and 1000x cheaper than a septic system. It had no operating costs and produced high-grade fertilizer. 

Which is one of industrial design's most disastrous failures (almost as bad as strollers and cribs). It wastes water. It wastes nutrients. It turns them into poison for ground water. It fails requiring costly repairs. It's a monument to self-hatred and fear of life.

Composting toilets are the future.

<!--&nbsp;-->

- top
	- platform made of 15--20 tongue and groove boards or 12--20 plywood
	- left and right boards, attach to bottom of platform and fit on top of left and right frame pieces between frame legs
	- hole is at least 20mm smaller than bucket opening all the way around 
	- attach toilet seat to top 

<!--pagebreak-->

![plan: toilet frame](/img/plan/image/toilet-frame.png)

plan: toilet frame - [download](/img/plan/toilet-frame.pdf)

<!--&nbsp;-->

- frame
	- made of 19-24 x 36-88 lumber
	- joint is extra strong, non-planar joint (see [gridbeam.com](https://gridbeam.com))
	- black dots indicate heads of screws. Always drill pilot holes for screws.
	- adjust leg height to allow a 15mm space between top of bucket and underside of toilet top
- skirt
	- made of thick plastic sheeting (0.15mm)
	- fits inside frame
	- top edge folds over horizontal frame pieces and get thumb-tacked or taped in place on outside
	- bottom edge runs to floor level. Put a pan, tray, towel, or paper on the floor under the bucket to catch spills.
	- toilet bucket goes inside
	- cut hole for return duct: 
		- next to a frame leg, to attach a wire or bracket to support duct
		- 50--100 off floor
		- 20-30 smaller than return duct to stretch and fit over it snugly

### bath

#### basic

A sponge bath.

#### upgrade

- on waterproof floor or large plastic sheet, make a 2m diameter border of towels. Sit in the middle 
- put warm water in 2, 1.5L soda bottles, with loose lids or nearly closed drinking spouts
- hold a bottle above yourself with one hand and wash with the other
- wipe up water with towels and squeeze it out into bucket
- hang towels to dry or give them to supporter

#### deluxe

This is a portable shower. It provides a thorough showering with only 4-10L of water. It has no connecting pipes and collapses for storage.

<!--pagebreak-->

**Parts**, top to bottom:

- hook (in ceiling, 50mm)
- bucket or bottle (4-10L, hangs from hook by handle)
- siphon tube (polyethylene, 4mm ID x 50cm, bent near its middle with heat to hook over rim of container)
- 4 cords (hung from hook, tied to curtain rod)
- curtain rod (common irrigation tubing, black polyethylene, 30mm OD, circular, 375cm long for 120cm diameter, dowel inside ends for smooth joint)
- curtain (polyester or plastic sheeting, with 15cm sleeve for rod (as shown) or grommets and rings, 5cm bottom hem with small river rocks inside to weigh it down)
- **x**=holes in curtain for cords to tie around curtain rod
- large tub (90L+, from garden supply store, catches everything at the bottom) or deep tray or pan.

Solar water heating method: nearly fill clear 4-8L bottles with water. Put rectangles of black plastic sheeting inside as elements. Put bottle in sun. Have supporter give it to you when warm. Or, with dark clothing and mask on tight, grab it from a sunny spot.

Adjust water temperature with cold water to suit yourself. Hang it from the hook. Suck on the tube to start the siphon action. Water flows for 8 minutes. Not bad. Dump used water into a 20L bucket with a lid for later disposal. Yes, all this is possible in darkness. I did it.

Adjust shower length and water flow with different size containers and tubes. Make sure hook can hold the weight.

That's the state of my art of low-cost, off-grid, DIY darkroom design and construction. As always, the principles involved (like, water flows downhill) are infinitely adaptable. Check back for the latest developments. If you design something simpler, faster, cheaper, more effective, more elegant, or just different, please let me know. See [open-source](/front/introduction#open-source).

That's also the end of the body of my book. Thank you for reading. I hope it helps you find yourself, recover your health in body and soul, feel joy, be successful in all ways, and be free of crime.
