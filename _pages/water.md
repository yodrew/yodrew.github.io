If you already have a bathroom and kitchen, great. If not, make the off-grid fixtures below. They are quick, cheap, and portable, like everything I design. If basic versions are too punk rock for you, try the upgrades. Improve them incrementally as you find out the value of retreating.

### sink

#### basic

- bucket with lid, 10-25L
- 1-2L soda bottle with cap, filled with water
- loosen cap slightly
- squeeze bottle over bucket, with or without lid. Use one hand or put it between your knees for hands-free use
- wash hands or food
- slide lid off bucket to drain water into bucket
- putting food waste in the bucket helps keep the smell down

#### upgrade

- table
- rectangular plastic basin, like a restaurant bus tub
- short stand, 30h x 30 x 40cm, behind basin
- 10 or 20L bottle with valve-cap on stand
- drinking water (if separate from wash water): in 20L bottle with valve-cap
- waste (water and food): two, 20L buckets with lids

#### deluxe

- salvaged sink set in a counter-height table
- drains directly into waste bucket
- upgrade again by adding a drain tube to outside. 

### toilet

Both designs below are composting bucket toilets. The basic design is simple and fast. The upgrade is ventilated, separating, and for squatting. The following applies to both:

- use
	- put 2L of sawdust in the bottom
	- put 15L more sawdust in another bucket by the toilet
	- with a scoop, put a 0.5L of sawdust in toilet after each use
	- place toilet by return vent, away from bed
- disposal
	- pour off liquid under trees and bushes
	- dump solids in a covered compost pile enclosed with wire fencing or plywood
	- dust it with dirt and cover with a 30--50- layer of carbonaceous material like leaves, straw, sawdust	
	- also put food scraps in pile 
	- let it sit for a year before use. Make a second pile meanwhile.

It's that simple, but I wrote more about [composting toilets](/blog/2024/02/compost-toilet) to allay concerns and provide more details

#### paper upgrade

Finally attain cleanliness behind. Prevent abrasion, itching, and infection. Replace toilet paper with water. 

Graphic description:

- prepare
	- wash out a 0.5--1L soda bottle 
	- poke a hole through the cap near the circumference at an angle with a large sewing needle
	- fill bottle with water, cap it, and put it near toilet with paper 
- paper
	- when finished pooping, remove most remaining poop with paper (any kind).
	- daub and lift it off, don't wipe or rub
	- put paper in bucket
- water
	- point hole in cap forward
	- hold bottle upside down behind your back
	- squeeze bottle and wet fingers of other hand
	- point stream at anus, wipe with one finger
	- use more fingers to finish cleaning
	- the big improvement over toilet paper becomes apparent at this point.
- finish
	- rinse off fingers
	- pat yourself dry with cloth or paper (avoid newspaper)
	- be happy
	
#### basic

- bucket: 20L / 5 gal
- seat:
	- regular toilet seat. Balance it or wire it on. 
	- snap-on lids are made for this. $15 at WalMart and online
	- slit a pool noodle and fit it over the edge of the bucket. Put a piece of cardboard over the top between uses.

Pros: simple, cheap, fast  
Cons: not ventilated, not stable enough for squatting, not separating (see upgrade)

#### upgrade

This is a minimalist composting toilet box. It is a light wooden frame and plastic skirt, not a heavy solid box. Highly adaptable. It:

- is for sitting or squatting
	- add seat adapter to connect a regular toilet seat
	- slope the toilet at 4° angle for more comfortable squatting (facing down) or sitting (facing up)
- is ventilated: no odor, even during use
- separates pee from poop: add rails for tub. Funnel urinal is possible.
- fits 20L bucket 
	- trim legs to fit yourself and a smaller bucket (8-16L)
	- removal: lift whole box or just one platform

<!--&nbsp;-->

Note: if you intend to use a separating tub (see option #3), get it first. Gap between platforms may need to be adjusted to fit it. This will also affect lengths of front, back, and spanner of toilet seat adapter. 

##### build

1. frame
	1. cut boards
	2. measure, mark, and drill pilot holes (smaller than screw threads, about same size as screw shaft)
	3. join legs to front and back
	4. join platforms to them
	5. when shortening legs, allow at least 15- between top of bucket and underside of toilet. Tub requires more, of course. It must pass over bucket.
2. skirt (attaches inside frame)
	1. cut a strip of ~0.15- plastic, 2044 x 425 (length of leg + 15)
	2. turn assembled toilet frame upside down
	3. coil plastic inside legs
	4. tape a short edge down the middle of a leg, upper corner level with end of leg
	5. fold 15- of lower edge onto underside of platform, taping it there with masking tape
	6. work your way around
	7. tape second short edge down same leg as first
	8. slit edge 15- at inside edges of platforms. Tape resulting flaps over front and back with plastic packing tape.
3. Put a pan, tray, or a plastic sheet with towel or paper on top on the floor under the bucket to catch spills.
4. ventilation 
	- room's return duct attaches at a hole in the skirt for continuous exhaust. Result: zero odor, even during use
	- cut hole for duct: 
		- next to a frame leg. Attach a wire or bracket to leg to support duct
		- 50--100- off floor
		- 10--30- smaller than return duct to fit over it snugly

##### options

1. toilet seat adapter
	- make adapter
	- attach toilet seat to it through 2 big holes
	- position adapter between platforms where comfortable. Seat should stick out 30-80-
	- drill pilot holes into platforms through screw holes in bridges
	- screw adapter into platforms
2. lifting platform - add brace to lifting side
	1. hinge
		1. trim 10- from back end of one platform 
		2. attach it to back with a heavy, 76- or 89- door hinge
		3. drill one pilot hole in the middle of the other end, a little smaller than ~3- dia nail 
		4. shorten and round end of nail so it will stick out of platform 20-. Put it through platform.
		5. enlarge pilot hole in the frame so the nail slides in and out of it
		6. swing platform up and out of the way to remove bucket
	2. removable
		1. use one nail as above at each end of a platform
		2. remove platform and set aside to empty bucket
	3. hinged adapter 
		1. use removable platform
		2. screw one bridge of toilet seat adapter into it as usual
		3. replace other with heavy 76- or 89- door hinge
		4. toilet seat and removable platform swing up to remove bucket
3. slope
	1. trim 4° off legs as drawn
	2. trim skirt
	3. why: balance for squatting is perfect
4. separating tub
	1. get ~3L squarish storage container, ~240 rim x ~80 depth
	2. adjust gap between platforms so tub fits between them
	3. make and attach rails as drawn
	4. comments
		- why: unwetted poop smells the least. Emptying is less frequent and messy. 
		- tub slides forward to catch pee, back over bucket to catch bidet water. Empty container into a pee bottle. 
		- this may be tricky in darkness. A wide single bucket that catches everything works, too. Then, when just peeing, use a vented [pee bottle](/report/2x3-day#mechanical-report). It works for men and adventurous women (or is adaptable). Or pee into small bucket and empty into food scrap bucket. Sugar in food scraps neutralizes odor of pee.
		- tub is too high for sitting. Sitting requires a low, large funnel and tube leading away, perhaps through a wall, to a container below. Buy or make a funnel: cut the bottom off a large square plastic bottle. Drill a hole in the cap. Put a small tube (8--15- ID) through it. Put a smooth, floating ball over the drain to seal out odor. Screw funnel to front board near top edge. This is a lot easier to manage than a tub when a squatting, too. 
		
### bath

#### basic

A sponge bath.

#### upgrade

- on waterproof floor or large plastic sheet, make a 2m diameter border of towels. Sit in the middle 
- put warm water in 2, 1.5L soda bottles, with loose lids or nearly closed drinking spouts
- hold a bottle above yourself with one hand and wash with the other
- wipe up water with towels and squeeze it out into bucket
- hang towels to dry or give them to supporter

#### deluxe

This is a portable shower. It provides a thorough showering with only 4-10L of water. It has no connecting pipes and collapses for storage. 

![plan: shower](/img/plan/image/shower.png)

<!--pagebreak-->

**Parts**, top to bottom:

- hook (in ceiling, 50mm)
- bucket or bottle (4-10L, hangs from hook by handle)
- siphon tube (polyethylene, 4mm ID x 50cm, bent near its middle with heat to hook over rim of container)
- 4 cords (hung from hook, tied to curtain rod)
- curtain rod (common irrigation tubing, black polyethylene, 30mm OD, circular, 375cm long for 120cm diameter, dowel inside ends for smooth joint)
- curtain (polyester or plastic sheeting, with 15cm sleeve for rod (as shown) or grommets and rings, 5cm bottom hem with small river rocks inside to weigh it down)
- **x**=holes in curtain for cords to tie around curtain rod
- large tub (90L+, from garden supply store, catches everything at the bottom) or deep tray or pan.

Solar water heating method: nearly fill clear 4-8L bottles with water. Put rectangles of black plastic sheeting inside as elements. Put bottle in sun. Have supporter give it to you when warm. Or, with dark clothing and mask on tight, grab it from a sunny spot.

Adjust water temperature with cold water to suit yourself. Hang it from the hook. Suck on the tube to start the siphon action. Water flows for 8 minutes. Not bad. Dump used water into a 20L bucket with a lid for later disposal. Yes, all this is possible in darkness. I did it.

Adjust shower length and water flow with different size containers and tubes. Make sure hook can hold the weight.

That's the state of my art of low-cost, off-grid, DIY darkroom design and construction. As always, the principles involved (like, water flows downhill) are infinitely adaptable. Check back for the latest developments. If you design something simpler, faster, cheaper, more effective, more elegant, or just different, please let me know.
