Born 1971, Twin Falls, Idaho, America. My family and elders trained me to think and to make things. My parents were mindful of diet.

At 16, [joy overwhelmed me](/darkness-conjecture/rapture). It prompted a full-time investigation into its cause for 21 years. I studied philosophy, health, and design independently, testing my findings while traveling America. I lived outside, with friends and relatives, and in small groups. I did odd jobs, played music, and built alternative shelters. Truth is free. Poverty helped me find it.

In 2008, I discovered darkness as the means nature provides us to heal from trauma, the cause of our suffering. Out of this came [_the darkness conjecture_](/darkness-conjecture/), the concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the selfâ€‹-healing psyche. I began focusing on:

- designing and building darkrooms
- doing and supporting retreats in America, Guatemala, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Czech Republic
- giving talks and consulting for readers
- refining and documenting my work at [darkroomretreat.com](/). 

[Proof of concept](/reports/2x3-day) came in 2013. I finished developing the model of hygienic darkroom retreating in 2019, working out all details of theory, protocol, and design. It became a practical solution. The phase of application began: bringing the solution to the world.

Poverty kept the idea safe until developed and I was ready to apply it. Ideas are applied with money. Here we go.
