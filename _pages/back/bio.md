Born 1971, Twin Falls, Idaho. 

My family and elders trained me to think and to make things.

At 16, [joy overwhelmed me](/conjecture/rapture). It inspired me to investigate its cause full-time for 21 years. I independently studied philosophy, health, and design, interests bequeathed by my parents. I tested my findings while traveling America. I lived outside, with friends and relatives, and in small groups I met. I played music, did odd jobs, and built alternative shelters.

In 2008, I discovered darkness as the means nature provides us to heal from trauma, the cause of our suffering. Out of this came the [*darkness conjecture*](/conjecture/), the concept of the restful use of darkness in support of the selfâ€‹-healing psyche. I began focusing on:

- designing and building darkrooms
- doing and supporting retreats in America, Guatemala, Sweden, Norway, Spain, and Czech Republic
- giving talks and consulting for readers
- refining and documenting my work at [darkroomretreat.com](/). 

2013 brought [proof of concept](/reports/2x3-day) and a rewriting of the conjecture into this book. Development of the model of hygienic darkroom retreating ended in late 2019. All details of theory, protocol, and design were worked out. It became a practical solution. The phase of application began: bringing the solution to the world. 

The [ladder](/format#ladder) is a step toward it, as well as the expansion of my [services](/back/services).
