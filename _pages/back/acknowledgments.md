Thanks to hundreds of people in a dozen countries on 2 continents for over 3 decades, who morally and materially aided me during my prodigal search, especially my Norwegian:

#### editors

...for heroic efforts to make this book real. In its triage, you were as merciful as you could be:

- Are Solheim, writer and fellow refugee in darkness, for seeing and believing in me and the book, for visionary editing, hosting me during the rewrite, and your compassion for mankind, even me
- Magnus Vanebo, philosopher, for enthusiastically diving into the text and sensitively editing it
- Also, Bertrand Besigye, famous poet and fellow journeyman in darkness, for early support of the book

#### collaborators


- Marion Abbott, for friendship, overflowing transworld conversations, and constant in-the-trenches support starting 2016
- Simen Kirker&oslash;d, friend, host, serious retreater and observer, with loads of ideas and help since 2013
- Johan J&auml;rlind: investor-partner, retreat supporter, confidant, and friend in critical years 2012-13. You gave me so much, I'm speechless except... thank you.
- Chrissy Weisgard: friend, host, client, morale-booster since 2009

#### family

Immediate, extended, and adopted: I leaned on all of you that would let me. It can't be easy rearing a stubborn 20, 30, then 40 year-old psychotic child in defiance of a world that denies everything real. Thanks, especially, to:

- Brother Paul, for shelter and guidance you should never have had to give
- Grandmother Anna Lou Craig Callen Posey, always there
- Brother Francois, for constant experience of love
- Cousin Christopher, for your generosity and grit
- Uncle Jim---dropout, drug dealer, beach bum, loser, cool-ass motherfucker---for laughingly giving the system the finger till the day you died. RIP, man.
- Trimurti: my second family, torn away as soon as I noticed, for helping further raise me

#### influences

...for friendship, support, and/or raising the bar so high that anti-gravity boots became necessary. And especially my elders: 

- Jack Nuckols: a giant and first among my elders, you stuck around and watched over me till I found my way. RIP.
- Willetta Warberg: you poured your heart and soul into me through your piano, kindness, and huge personality. RIP.
- John Boyer: you fed me with so much of your _time_.
- Purna Steinitz: you destroyed my sentimentality and kept your terrible promise.
- DeWaynn Rogers: you helped me get up, push back, and stay out of the system's clutches. RIP.
- Harold: you showed me my job.

Each of you gave me the world.

#### old friends

- John Roberts: lifelong friend, biggest supporter, and host
- Danny Meulbroek: guardian, supporter, and host extraordinaire 
- Evelyn Thomas and Sterling Voss: supporters, fellow investigators and survivors

#### end

I called some people here guides, but anyone who hosted me also guided me. I've needed a lot of help for a long time. Everyone on this list put a lot of time and energy into me and my work.

I also made enemies and hurt some people along the way. I'm sorry it didn't go the way we thought at first. Here's hoping it was not in vain.

Onward, then, till the task is complete.
