Join the dolphin economy: I help you help me help you help me help you...

Here is how: 

- read
	- my book
	- the books in my bibliography
- apply
    - darken your room
    - retreat according to this method at home or at a center
- interact
    - send me a question or comment
    - buy this book after reading it, if not before, and you find it useful
    - report your experience online with photos and send me the link
- engage
    - tell me about spelling and grammatical errors you find in the book
    - improve the website
    - improve the method and designs; see below
    - publish the book; see [license](/back/license)
    - invite me to speak at an event
- further
    - see [services](/back/services)
    - help me organize a retreat so I can heal from my own psychosis
    - do something not listed above, perhaps what only you know about or that we could develop together

More regarding improvements:

If you find a theoretical or practical error in the approach, or a way to improve it, please let me know. I am happy to alter the book if your proposal:

- presents a rational argument
- remains consonant with hygienic principles
- includes clear reports of your own reproducible experiments with the current method
- is courteously offered

Likewise, I would like to work with you in any way to develop hygienic darkroom retreating and advance its cause if you:

- have read my book 
- demonstrate understanding of its basic ideas
- have retreated according to my protocol and are convinced of the value of my approach

Cheers.
