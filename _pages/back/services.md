I do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating: study, experiment, write, speak, consult, design, build, operate, support.

I do nothing related to other approaches to dark retreating: the spiritual, therapeutic, and psychedelic. There is no use asking. I have suffered too much tragedy related to these things to ever consider them again. Perhaps this book will help you re-evaluate your approach. I do consult about this.

### retreat

I support retreats, either at my place in America, or yours anywhere America has good relations. Retreats are 11 days: a [9-day Czech retreat](/format#czech) + 2 buffer days. 

Instructions:

1. read my book
2. send me your completed [questionnaire](#questionnaire). Use this [form](/resource/questionnaire) or [email](/about#contact) it with $40 fee ([pay](#pay) below). Non-refundable, so ([address concerns](/about#contact) beforehand). I'll call soon for interview.
3. once approved, [enroll](/resource/enroll) with fee to reserve a month for your retreat. See retreat prices there.
4. Deposit 50% (minus fees) within 5 days, plus any cost of my travel
3. Pay balance 2 months before retreat or upon my arrival
6. Pick a starting date between 1 and 15, 1 month before your month. 
7. retreat
