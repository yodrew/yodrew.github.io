I do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating: study, experiment, write, speak, consult, design, build, operate, support.

I do nothing related to active approaches to dark retreating: spiritual, therapeutic, or psychedelic. 

Find more information on everything below in my [store](/store).

#### retreat

If you plan to retreat on your own, I can [confer](/store/confer) with you about your questionnaire by email and phone.

I [support](/support) retreats remotely. Start by conferring with me.

I support retreats in person at my place or yours. They are 11 days: a [9-day Czech](/format#czech) retreat + 2 buffer days. 

The process is to read, [confer](/store/confer), reserve, book, and retreat. See [enroll](/store/enroll) for details.


Marion Abbott of Australia at [Profound Rest Retreats](https://profoundrest.wordpress.com) is also organizing retreats. Simen Kirker√∏d of Norway can do it, too (write me).
