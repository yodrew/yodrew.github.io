I do everything related to hygienic darkroom retreating: study, experiment, write, speak, consult, design, build, operate, support.

I do nothing related to other approaches to dark retreating: the spiritual, therapeutic, and psychedelic. There is no use asking. I have suffered too much tragedy related to these things to ever consider them again. Perhaps this book will help you re-evaluate your approach. I do consult about this.

#### retreat

I support retreats, either at my place in America, or yours anywhere America has good relations. Retreats are 11 days: a [9-day Czech retreat](/format#czech) + 2 buffer days. 

Instructions:

1. read my book
2. send me your completed [questionnaire](/prepare#questionnaire). 
	- [Email](/about#contact) it with $40 fee ([pay](/back/services#pay) below)
	- or use this [form](/resource/questionnaire)
	- Fee is non-refundable, so [address concerns](/about#contact) beforehand
	- I'll call soon for interview.
3. once approved, [enroll](/resource/enroll) to reserve a month for your retreat. See retreat prices there.
4. Deposit 50% (minus fees) within 5 days, plus any cost of my travel
3. Pay balance 2 months before retreat or upon my arrival
6. Pick a starting date between 1 and 15, 1 month before your month. 
7. Retreat!

#### speak

Invite me to speak to an audience.

$1000 + expenses.

#### consult

Get my advice on hygienic darkroom retreating, building darkrooms for hygienic retreats, and dealing with issues arising thereof.

$40/hour, 1 hour minimum.

I will respond in detail, by email or messenger app, to all your questions and concerns about:

- how, where, and why to set up a darkroom
- how to organize a retreat with a supporter
- how to deal with specific issues you have personally and about retreating itself

My responses will be based on my experience. Since 2006, I have:

- done 27 retreats from 2-7 days long
- supported 30 retreats for others
- designed and built or upgraded 30 darkrooms, operated 3 of them, and consulted remotely on 4 more, in 4 climates on 4 continents 
- written 200,000 words about darkroom retreating for web, email, and print
- given 14 public talks

##### confer

I will read your [questionnaire](/prepare#questionnaire) and discuss it with you by phone if you are retreating at home. [Email](/about#contact) me your questionnaire and pay (below). or Use this [form](/resource/questionnaire). I'll call soon.

The point is to make sure you understand the idea thoroughly. You probably get it in principle but have missed some details. They can trip you up in darkness. Or make you miss subtle opportunities.

I will be reading and listening for ways your conditioning is holding out. I will point them out to you. In hygienic psychological fashion, you don't try to defend or change them. You are simply prepared if they surface in darkness and try to bamboozle you again.

$40.

#### design-build

I design and build darkrooms as part of supporting [retreats](/back/services#retreat), from scratch or in existing buildings. [Email](/about#contact) me.

See my [hygienic house](/plan) for some of my latest thinking. A vaulted mobile building is also in the works.

$40/hr.

I plan to manufacture all my designs as well as jigs and tools for others to make them. Let me know if you have an interest in them.
