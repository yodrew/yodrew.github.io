The main thing you need to prepare for a successful retreat is knowledge. Thus, this book. The **instructions** outline the process. **Terms** bring it down to earth. The **quiz** in the **q-form** helps you solidify your grasp of the text. The **questionnaire** orients you toward your own retreat. **Menu** and **gear** sections guide your material preparations.

I am available to [confer](/back/services#confer) about your completed questionnaire. If you have clients one day, use it with them. Please share your modifications with me.

As of 2024, I support [retreats](/back/services#retreat) again. Someday, there will be many centers that support hygienic darkroom retreats. Your retreat cannot wait till then. Do it yourself at home. Use a friend's place or a vacation rental. Or enroll with me in America or my collaborators in Australia or Norway.

Once you do it yourself, others will want to know about it. You will naturally have opportunities to share it: with a friend, or in an announcement, public talk, book club, class, workplace, or online. Climb the [ladder](/format#ladder).

### instructions

1. Finish reading this book.
2. Complete the questionnaire below.
3. Consider when you would like to retreat. See example [schedules](/format#schedule).
4. Consider where you would like to retreat.
	- if at home, build a darkroom (see remaining chapters)
	- if not, [retreat](/back/services#retreat) with me, [Marion](https://profoundrest.wordpress.com) or [inquire](/about#contact) about Simen.
5. Gather gear and retreat!

### questionnaire

Copy and paste this into a text file and complete it for yourself. Send it to a supporter.

If I'm the supporter, see [retreat](/back/services#retreat) for further instructions. 

I also [confer](/back/services#confer) about questionnaires as a service.

#### personal

- Respond simply: 1-3 sentences are usually enough.

    	- complex fatty foods: nuts or seeds

#### guide

Most of the time, just eat plain fruit.

- eat one fruit until you lose your taste for it
- if still hungry, switch to another
- start with the wettest foods (melons), end with the driest (bananas, dates)
- eat greens anytime

On some days, have a yummy recipe:

- sweet green salads (midday or evenings)
	- melon
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 2 L watermelon, chopped (only combine one kind of melon with one green, otherwise stomach ache)
	- banana
		- 1/2 head romaine, chopped
		- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
		- 4 bananas, ripe
		- 1 L strawberries or blueberries or chopped nectarines
	- citrus
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 5 sprigs parsley
		- 3 oranges, peeled, sectioned, cut in half
		- 2 apples, chopped
		- 2 slices pineapple, chopped
- savory salads (evenings)
	- tomato
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
		- 1dL rocket lettuce
		- 1 orange, chopped very finely (into pulp)
		- 5dL tomato, chopped
		- 1/2 avocado or 1dL olives
	- dry
		- 1 head romaine, chopped
		- 10 sprigs parsley or cilantro
		- 1 orange, chopped very finely 
		- 2 red bell pepper, chopped finely
		- 2dL mushrooms OR zucchini, chopped

Come up with your own based on above patterns. No more than 6 ingredients per recipe. The trick to making yummy savory salads is to include these 8 flavors and textures in varying proportions in each dish:

bitter, sweet, sour, salty, savory, spicy, crunchy, fatty

- bitter: tender greens like romaine and young spinach, celery, and mild culinary herbs like parsley and cilantro
- sweet: fruit!
- sour: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, berries
- salty: celery, tomatoes
- savory: tomatoes, olives (rinse off oil)
- spicy: just a hint, barely enough to notice. Spicy greens are best, like rocket, arugula, mustard, cilantro
- crunchy: celery, apple
- fatty
    - with sufficient chewing, oiliness of lettuce is usually enough
    - tricky because it is surprisingly easy to overeat fat
        - eat only one kind of fatty food per day
        - eat a small quantity once per 2-5 days: 1 small avocado, 15 olives
        - stick to fatty fruits like avocado and olives (rinse off any oil from packaging)
        - eat 5-6% of your daily calories from fat, no more than 10%. Track your calories for two weeks. It's surprising. Use nutrition tables, websites, or apps.

Just say no to: 

- nuts, seeds
- fractured foods: oil, juice, dried food
- ferments. Vinegar, for example, is the second stage of fermentation, beyond alcohol formation, and even more toxic. It's a digestive disaster.)
- onions, garlic, ginger
- spices, salt

These substances imbalance, overload, or destroy digestive chemistry, bacteria, and enzymes. The good things you hear about vinegar, garlic, and ginger are old wives' tales, wishful thinking, or industry-sponsored hype. 

If you would like to know more about this menu before trying it, see:

- [food](/darkroom-retreat#food) and [food](/protocol#food2)
- Dr Douglas Graham's masterful [80/10/10 Diet](https://foodnsport.com)
- [Loren Lockman's videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/LorenLockman)

If, for whatever reason, you cannot yet eat this way in a retreat, eat as simply and naturally as you know how. For suggestions, write me with your limitations. Give more attention to it later when your motivation and capacity increase.

### gear

- Yes:
    - bedsheets and pillow (if retreating at a center and need these provided, let supporter know ahead of time)
    - pajamas and loose clothes
    - sweater
    - slippers
    - water bottles totaling 3L at least, more if you are bigger than 80kg
    - clock (unlit analog or red LCD)
    - cellphone
    - red LED light
    - materials and tools for plugging any light leaks you discover during your retreat
        - masking tape
        - black electrical tape, 1 roll
        - black plastic sheeting
        - black polar fleece, 50cm x 20cm
        - scissors
        - table knife 
        - bamboo skewer
    - toiletries and personal items
    - prescription medication
- No: 
    - contraband
    - cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, or plant medicines
    - electronic devices that make sound, light, vibration, or smell: phones, computers, audio players, watches, clocks, vaporizers, oils, massage devices, etc
    - if you must bring any of these things, turn them off and store them during the retreat, maybe with your supporter. If something is so critical for your survival you will be sick or injured without it, keep it with you and tell your supporter, before coming if possible. He needs to know what might happen.

This ends the retreat part of the book. You've learned how to arrange and do a retreat. The hygienic theory you learned before is sinking in. Now, you just need a darkroom. They don't grow on trees.
