A real whopper on wireless radiation from our friends in the Navy. Everyone who was anyone in the rollout of wireless technology knew this stuff 50 years ago. That they went full steam ahead anyway tells you what position we occupy in their view.

#### Biological Phenomena ('Effects') and Clinical Manifestations Attributed to Microwave and Radio-Frequency Radiation

Abstract: More than 2000 references on the biological responses to radio frequency and microwave radiation, published up to June 1971, are included in the bibliography. Particular attention has been paid to the effects on man of non-ionizing radiation at these frequencies. The citations are arranged alphabetically by author, and contain as much information as possible so as to assure effective retrieval of the original documents. An outline of the effects which have been attributed to radio frequency and microwave radiation is also part of the report.

##### Foreword

It is the hope of the author that this bibliography will provide guidance to the diffuse and conflicting literature on the biological responses to electromagnetic radiation at radio- and microwave-frequencies, with particular reference to the effects of concern to man. Such guidance is needed in the formulation and appraisal of criteria and limits of human exposure to "non-ionizing" radiation, and in the planning and conduct of future research...
